00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.210
这是个简单的故事
This is a simple story...

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.880
但不易说
but not an easy one to tell.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.180
像寓言  有悲有喜
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.970
也像寓言  让人不可思议
and, like a fable, it is full of wonder and happiness.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.850
1939年  意大利中部

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
我唱我所见  没有什么能逃过我的双眼
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.590
我对混乱说  我在这儿
"Here I am," said I to chaos.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.280
我是你的奴隶  混沌赞  好
"I am your slave!" And he: "Good."

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.110
我说  用不着你赞好
"For what?" said I.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.160
我终于自由  比起我的喜悦...
Free in the end, I am! What good is a caress when bliss...

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.040
你的赞好  算是什么
this man came to possess?

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.000
我已经准备好
Here I am, ready.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.800
像火车般飞驰  然而刹掣不管用
The trains are gone, the brakes are gone.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.510
我再也无法抵抗  迷人的酒神啊  带上我
And I can resist no more. Go, sweet Bacchus, take me.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.760
刹闸不管用  刹闸不管用
The brakes are gone! The brakes are gone!

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020
我听到了
I heard you.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.140
-刹闸失灵了  -踩下去
- No, they're really gone! - Hit the brakes!

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.390
我还以为你在念诗
Weren't you reciting a poem?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.820
汽车刹不住
It doesn't work!

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.990
刹车
Brake!

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.620
我们死定了  树林
We're going to die! The woods!

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.330
刹车
Brake!

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.970
国王驾到
The king is coming!

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.520
国王来了
There he is!

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.940
前面人潮涌动  直驶
It's full of people down there. Straight.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.560
刹闸没了
We have no brakes!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.820
我们没有刹闸  挪开
We have no brakes! Move!

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.090
美丽人生
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.110
出去走动走动
Go for a walk.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.730
否则明天也到不了
Otherwise, we'll get there tomorrow.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.650
我找到螺丝了
I found the screw.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.740
你现在需要什么
Now what do you need?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740
没别的  只要让我清静10分钟
Nothing. I need ten minutes alone.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.030
行  我走开
All right, I’ll leave you alone.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.840
要刚才的螺丝吗
Do you want the screw from before?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160
不要  只要你走开
No, I just want to be alone.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.470
如果找到了颗螺丝  我应该扔掉吗
Do I toss out the screw if I find it?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.440
就让我一个人待10分钟吧
I need ten minutes alone.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.360
那我去洗洗手
I'm washing my hands.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.160
小姑娘  你好
Pretty girl! How's it going?

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.460
在干什么
What are you doing?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.380

Did your mom put this stuff here?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.800
不  是女房东的
No, the landlady did.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.510
在摆卖吗  好极了
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.760

How much is it? How old are you?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.590
看来是我问的太多了  你叫什么
I ask too many questions. What's your name?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.800

吓死我了  差点没摔死  有没有压伤你
How frightening. I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.530
没啥大事
I've never been better.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.440
你一向都飞身下楼
Do you always leave the house like this?

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.700
我想烧黄蜂巢  却被蜇了
I wanted to burn that wasps' nest, but I got stung.

黄蜂毒得狠
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

-只是野蛮人而已  -为何不呼救

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.520
此时无声胜有声
Silence is the most powerful cry.

你们要住多久都可以  我可没空陪你们

那张床  据说一位革命家睡过

Stop it! What are you, crazy?

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.950
这是市里  不是乡下
You can't act like you do in the country.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.660

You've been yelling like a madman. You can't yell!

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.000
玛莉  钥匙
Mary! The key!

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.500

See? You can't yell.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.510
你不应该整天吟诗
Understand? If you stopped thinking so much about poetry...

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.640
应该去赚赚钱  令你爸爸放心
you'd make your father happier and you'd make more money than him.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.650
对  Oreste  我正那样劝他

- Miss, what's going on? - Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.980
-只签一个名  -不签
- Just one signature. - No, I can't.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.520
会有人接替我一小时  问他吧
My substitute will be here in an hour. Ask him.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.700
-就签一下吧  -我们一点休息
- All I need is a signature. - We close at one here!

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.410
现在还有10分钟
It's ten to one.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.160
你不服气  尽管投诉
File a complaint.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.790
真黑心  他只要签个名  填份资料
Boy, is he nasty. To sign a paper, open a file,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.010
我就可以立即递申请表
all he had to do was...

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.090
却硬要我等一个钟头
Now I have to wait one hour for his substitute.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.100
我要投诉  写下来  本人Guido...
I'm filing a complaint. Write, "I, the undersigned..."

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.810
糟糕
What a wallop!

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.230
有没有伤到  我帮你
Are you hurt? I’ll help you.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.440
我不是故意的
Come here. I didn't do it on purpose.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.860
别碰我
Don't touch me!

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.990
你以后休想开书店
You can forget about your bookshop!

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.030
不要戴  有蛋
No, the eggs!

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.500
臭小子  我要杀了你
You scoundrel! I’ll kill you!

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.890
让开
Out of the way!

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.320
早安  公主
Good morning, Princess.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.030
我们能够站着见面就好
I wonder if we'll ever bump into each other standing up.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.910
对不起  我赶时间
Excuse me, but I've got to run.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.040
再见  公主
Farewell, Princess!

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.310
-鸡肉  -没问题
- Chicken. - That's easy.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.770
上整只的  鸡屁股向下
It's served whole, bottom down on the plate.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.270
-可以替我切吗  -当然
"Will you cut it for me?" "Naturally."

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.110
我抓稳  一刀向鸡膀下捅进去
I stick the blade under the wing

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.950
将鸡腿扯掉
then I rip off the drumstick.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.120
然后起鸡胸肉
I cut the meat along the bottom of the breastbone.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.120
-扯掉鸡翅  切掉鸡胸 扒掉鸡皮
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.450
龙虾
Lobster

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.040
易如反掌
Piece of cake, Uncle.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.540
一刀向虾翼下捅进去...
I stick the wing under the leg.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.250
起虾腿  扭龙虾  一刀...
Off goes the leg. I rip off the lobster, stick the...

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.130
龙虾是甲壳类动物
Lobster is a crustacean.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.680
把这甲壳类动物...
Off goes the crust...

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.350
起虾壳
of the crustacean.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.270
起虾须  虾须吃不得吧
Off go the crust and antennae. Who eats the antennae?

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.350
去掉虾须  去掉龙虾
Off go the antennae, off goes the lobster.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.360
片甲不留
There's nothing left.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.610
没有龙虾  但有色香味美的鸡
We're out of lobster, but the chicken is delicious.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.400
我忘了怎样上龙虾
I don't remember how to do lobster.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.790
直接从厨房捧出来
You serve it as is.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.380
连碰也不用碰
There's no need to touch it!

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.710
真容易  难怪我没记住
That's too easy. That's why I didn't remember.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.510
-继续啊  -老实点
- Continue. - Behavior!

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.260
在桌旁站定  像这样
Stand by. Still, like this.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.170
-服务员  -在
"Waiter?" "Yes?"

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.510
站定  候命  服务员
In position. Stand by behavior. Waiter!

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.110
怎么专叫我  怎不叫其他人
Why only me? There must be other waiters, right?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.410
鞠躬  难到哪去
Bowing! Piece of cake.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.750
鞠得再低些
You bow down, further.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.950
像这个香槟瓶  45度
Like this, at a 45 degree angle, just like a champagne bottle.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.170
45度  甚至50度  55度
45 degrees, even 50, 55.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.420
90度  直角  180度
90 degrees. A right angle. 180.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.680
还得鞠多低  180度  像这样吗
How far do I bow down? 180 degrees? Like this?

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.020
学向日葵  向日葵向太阳鞠躬
Think of a sunflower. They bow to the sun.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.600
鞠得太低的向日葵...
But if you see some that are too bowed down...

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.480
已经枯死  你是侍者  不是下人
it means they're dead! You're serving. You're not a servant.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.620
服务是高精艺术
Serving is a supreme art.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.400
上帝是第一位侍者
God is the first servant.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.690
上帝为人服务  但上帝不是下人
God serves men, but he's not a servant to men.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.410
-没有钮  -傻子  不应该有钮
- There was no button here. - It doesn't go there, silly.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.450
我要把车开回家  还给爸爸  他还得用呢
I have to take the car back to Pop. He's counting on it.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.670
一个月后再开回去吧
You'll take it back in a month or so.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.390
不  我很快就会开回去的  你知道怎么回事吗
No, I've got to get it back soon. You know why?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.180
怎么回事
Why?

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.730
-几点了  -你睡着了吗
- What? What time is it? - Were you sleeping?

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.110
当然睡着
Of course I was.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.190
你能一边说一边睡
You fell asleep while talking to me!

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.240
-你怎么做到的  -叔本华
- How did you do that? - Schopenhauer.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.860
叔本啥
Who?

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.960
叔本华  他说过  意志决定一切
Schopenhauer says that with willpower, you can do anything.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.920
我想怎样  就能怎样
"I am what I want to be."

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.830
我想睡着  于是说...
Right now I want to sleep, so I was saying to myself...

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.050
睡着吧  睡着吧  于是我就睡着了
"I'm sleeping, sleeping," and I fell asleep.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.010
真神奇  也很简单
Amazing. And it's simple too.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.170
我也试试
I want to try too.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.480
睡着吧  睡着吧  睡着吧
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.860
不要动手  现在不是玩杂耍
Don't move your hands. You're not a juggler.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.110
这是思想的功夫  要认真  慢慢来
It's a matter of thought. It's serious, and it takes time.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.070
明天再说吧
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.860
神奇啊
Amazing, though.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.040
醒过来
Wake up.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.670
醒过来
Wake up.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.340
又怎样  做什么
What is it now? What are you doing?

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.710
-凑效了  -什么凑效了
- It totally works! - What works?

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.130
叔本华  我刚刚说  醒过来
Schopenhauer. You know what I just said? "Wake up."

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.730
你就立即醒了过来  这理论太不可思议了
Bam, you woke up. This theory is incredible.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.560
-好使吧  -你冲着我的耳朵喊
- How does it work? - You were yelling in my ear!

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.230
我能不醒吗
That's why I woke up.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.030
-我该温柔点吗  -根本不该出声
- So I should say it quieter. - Don't say it at all!

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.280
好深奥啊
It's deep.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.360
要运用精神力量
You have to think it.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.540
跑什么  慢点
Why are you running? Slow down!

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.130
快点  已经迟了
Hurry up. It's late!

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.960

Mary, the key!

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.640
每天早晨  她都把钥匙扔下来
Every morning, she throws the key.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.100
看
Look!

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.020
那女教师好标致啊
There's that teacher. Boy, is she pretty.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.230
连做梦都梦见她
I even dreamt about her.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.430
来  我给你介绍
Come with me. I’ll introduce you.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.110

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.910
不要动
Don't move!

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.650
车上的人  是那鸡蛋淋头的混蛋
The one in the car. He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.320
他见到我  会跟我拼命的
He'll kill me if he sees me. Be good.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.660
-他在干什么  -在说话
- What's he doing? - He's talking.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.870

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.750
-他在干什么  -道别
- What's he doing? - He's saying goodbye.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.550
他的那部车和我的一模一样
He's got a car just like mine!

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.010
他来了
There he is!

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.630
不要动  他看到我我就死定了
Don't move. He'll kill me if he sees me!

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.340
不要动  Ferruccio
Stay still, Ferruccio.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.680

It's you again. How do you do this?

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.070
是那个从天而降的公主
This is the princess who fell from the sky into my arms.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.120
他是那个替你吸取毒液的人吗

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.750
是  我们经常无意碰见
Yes. We keep meeting like this. You just suddenly show up.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.700

We could make plans to meet.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.090
-今晚八点  -不  还是这样好

她喜欢我突然出现

你是个天才
You're a genius!

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.460
越多越看不见
"The bigger it is, the less you see it."

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.050
谜底是  黑暗
Solution: obscurity.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.500
了不起
Marvelous.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.760
-你自作的谜语  -不是
- Did you make that riddle up? - No,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.020
你五分钟就猜出来了  我却用了八天
but you solved it in five minutes. It took me eight days.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.600
黑暗
Obscurity!

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.890

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.320
我再出个谜
Listen to this one, Guido.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.100
不如轮到我出
If I may, it's my turn.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.030
我小时候  听父亲说过
My pop told me this when I was a wee boy.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.490
白雪公主切饼招待七个小矮人
"The dwarves and Snow White sit down for a bite.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.630
白雪公主切饼要切多
How fast can you guess what she serves her guests next?"

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.590
相当复杂
It sounds refined.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.470
我现在就试一下
I want to solve it right now.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.970
吃完再猜吧  菜都凉了
Eat first or it'll get cold.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.970
我反正没胃口  时间太晚
I don't want to. It's too late.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.470
沙拉  三文鱼和白酒  都易消化
Salad, salmon, white wine. It's light.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.270

有位视学官从罗马来  想吃东西

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.360
厨师收工了
The kitchen is closed.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.040

厨师开工了
The kitchen is open.

白雪公主和七个小矮人…
"The dwarves and Snow White..."

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.110
既然厨房收工了  来点凉菜就行
I know the kitchen is closed. Maybe a cold dish.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.190

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.650
还有配菜呢
There's a side dish too?

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.030
任您选择  我们有香炸鲜菇
Of course. We have very, very fried mushrooms...

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.820
牛油浓汁炆薯仔
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter with a flaky sauce--

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.660
我只要点清淡的沙拉  没有就什么都不要
Is there a small, light salad? If not, nothing.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.620
清淡的沙拉  真可惜啊  香炸鲜菇…
A light salad? What a pity. The very, very fried mushrooms...

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.250
滋味无穷  清淡沙拉…
were out of this world. So, a light salad...

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.880

白雪公主多久才切完饼

晚安  天才
Good night, genius.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.220
他说什么了  白雪公主  喝茫了吧
What did he say? The dwarves? What is he, drunk?

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.930
是个谜语  谜底是”七秒”
It's a riddle. "Seven seconds."

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.230
答案是七秒  白雪公主和七个小矮人
"Seven seconds" is the solution. "The dwarves and Snow White."

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.400
如果有七个小矮人吃饼
If there are seven dwarves dining...

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.240
每人一份的话  总共就是”七秒”
and she serves seconds, that means "seven seconds."

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.240
second有”份”和”秒”两个意思

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.700
Lessing医生太忠直老实了
Doctor Lessing is a physician, a very serious person.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.250
但他猜谜猜上瘾了  废寝忘食的
But he's obsessed with riddles. He loses sleep over them.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.210
请问方济各学校...

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.860

我们知道
We know.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.210
最近  我们和罗马来的视学官...
As you know, the inspector...

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.500
还有意大利最权威的科学家
came from Rome to talk to us about the race manifesto...

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.710

是普天之下...

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.390

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.280
那是当然
Naturally!

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.660
我们的种族是最优越的
Our race is superior.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.790
小朋友  我老远从罗马来...
I've just come from Rome, right this minute...

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:12.040
是要教导你们  我们的种族
to come and tell you in order that you'll know, children...

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.330
是最优越的种族
that our race is a superior one.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.800
我被...
I was...

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.970
意大利的种族主义科学家...
chosen, I was, by racist Italian scientists...

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.600
选中  来证明
in order to demonstrate...

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.890
我们种族的优越性
how superior our race is.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.520
孩子们  他们为什么偏偏选中我呢
Why did they pick me, children?

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.940
问得多余
Must I tell you?

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.740
比我更英俊的男子...
Where can you find...

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.540
试问世间有没有
someone more handsome than me?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.080
当然没有
Justly so, there is silence.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.540
我是纯正日耳曼人  最优越的种族
I'm an original "superior race".

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.340
或许有人问...
Let's start with something that one says:

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.600
你怎么优越了
"What's so big about that?"

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.760
耳朵  看看这耳朵多么完美
The ear. Look at the perfection of this ear.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.690
一弯耳轮...
Left auricle...

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.310
末端垂着耳珠  像个小铃铛
with a pendant little bell at the end.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.360
精巧的软骨  活动自如
Check it out. Movable cartilage.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.810
可伸可缩
Bendable.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.780
有这样的美耳  舍我其谁
Find two ears more beautiful than these and I’ll leave!

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.660
你们找到另一对  我就卷铺盖走人
But you have to show me them. They dream about these in France!

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.500
世间有不同种族  理所当然
Races exist, children. You bet they do!

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.420
继续  还有别的  我来示范
But let's continue. I want to show you something else.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.210
大家留神
Pay attention.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.000
他自称  视学官
He said Inspector?

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.920
从罗马来
From Rome?

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.130
肚脐
The belly button!

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.100
看吧  脐带绑得多巧妙
Take a look at this belly button! What a knot!

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.520
而且解不开  用牙咬也咬不开
But you can't untie it, not even with your teeth!

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.650
种族主义科学家想解  只是妄想
Those racist scientists tried it. Not a chance!

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.110
这意大利肚脐  属于我们的种族
This is an Italian belly button. It's part of our race!

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.820
欣赏一下我的体形
Check out this style!

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.610
看看这些肌肉
Look at these muscles:

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.830
单头肌  二头肌  三头肌

美仑美奂  见识见识这臀部
Look at this beauty! Admire this hip!

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.260
婀娜多姿
Just look at the movement!

诸位
Gentlemen!

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.800
我要道别了
I must say goodbye now.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.820
不得不走  有约要赴
I have to go. I have an appointment.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.110
我要告辞了  日耳他式的高贵离场
I’ll make my Aryan exit and bid you farewell.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.530
后会有期  大家保重肚脐
Farewell! The belly button!

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.280
在威尼斯见  公主
I’ll see you in Venice, Princess.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.780
我只能用这对耳朵才听得到
I can only hear out of this ear.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.390
望过来吧  公主
Look at me, Princess.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.970

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.920
转过头来  公主
Turn around, Princess.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:21.180
转过来  转过来
Turn around, around...

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.350
-我们想吃巧克力冰激凌  -那要快点吃
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream? - Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.600
为什么
Why?

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.480
局长约了我们八点去吃饭
We have to be at the prefect’s at eight. We were invited to dinner.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.450

Your mother is coming too.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.950

一起去吧  喝杯咖啡  坐一坐就走
Let us just go to dinner. We'll stop by the prefect’s for coffee.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.630
我不去
I'm not coming!

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.210
你不想去是吧  那我推掉他算了
All right, I heard you! I’ll tell him we're not going.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.170
我们俩个去别的地方吃吧
It’ll just be me and you.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.350
-你好  Rodolfo  -你好  局长

有没有把那匹布搬下车
Did you take that stuff out of the car?

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.800
是丝绸  小心  不要刮花
It's silk. Don't ruin it. Be very careful.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.800
-这出戏真好看  -精彩
- What an opera. - Beautiful!

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.310
布帘是你的吗
Is that one of your curtains?

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.140
不  是我同事的
No, it must be one of my colleague's.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.240
他又怎么又偷我帽子
He took my hat again!

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.490
-我们走  -你没看见外面下雨呢吗
- Let's go. - Don't you see how it's raining?

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.080
-你把车开过来  -就在附近
- You go get the car. - It's right around the corner.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.910
好  你在这里等
All right, you wait here.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.240
我会开过来  然后按喇叭
I’ll pull up right here and toot.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.120
钥匙拿来
Give me the key!

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.130
不是门钥匙  是车钥匙
Not the house key! The car key!

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.970
车钥匙  你有病啊
The car key? Are you crazy?

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.100
那个鸡蛋淋头的混蛋...
Keep him busy, you know, the jerk the eggs fell on.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.770
你去尽量拖住他  我们晚上见
Keep him busy as long as you can. I’ll see you tonight.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.970
车上坐着…  慢点开
Inside the car there's... Go slow!

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.620
你起码应该带把雨伞来
The least you could have done is come get me with the umbrella.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.340
你一点风度都没有  看  给我弄得多狼狈
You're just plain rude. Look what a mess I am.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.800
还要我应酬局长  好不自在
Plus, dinner at the prefect's gets me so nervous!

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.590
如果我感到不自在...
I knew it. I've got the hiccups.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.020
我一定打嗝
I always get them when I'm made to do something I don't want to.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.100
其实我没有什么别的要求
Don't you know that it takes so little to make me happy?

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.450
一两杯巧克力冰激凌  我就满足了
A chocolate ice cream is enough! Even two!

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.360
大家散散步  自自然然
A nice walk together and then whatever happens happens.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.780
可是你却...
Instead you...

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.210
早安  公主
Good morning, Princess!

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.670
又是你  你应该向我解释
This is incredible. You owe me an explanation.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.960
不  你才应该向我解释
No, you're the one who owes me an explanation!

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.840
你从天而降  落入我怀里
I stop under a roof and you fall from the sky into my arms.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.510
我从单车摔下  摔进你的怀里
I fall off my bicycle and end up in your arms.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.680
我去巡视学校  又碰到你
I do an inspection at school, and there you are again!

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.150
我连做梦都梦见你
You even turn up in my dreams.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:54.530
让我清净清净行不行  你对我太痴缠
Will you leave me alone? You've really got a crush on me.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.320
也难怪  不过...
I don't blame you, but...

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.580
好吧  我投降  你赢了
All right. At this point, I give in. You win.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.460
我们到哪去  海  喜欢海吗
Where shall we go, Princess? To the sea! Do you like the sea?

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.870
载我回剧院吧  有人等我呢
Yes, but they're waiting for me at the theater. Take me back.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.510
什么事
What's happening?

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.140
公主  知道怎么开雨刷吗
Princess, do you know how to turn on the windshield wipers?

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.090
刹车
Step on the brakes!

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.930
不用怕  坐稳了
Have no fear! Hang on to me!

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.400
方向盘坏了
It's broken!

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.310
你什么时候学的开车
When did you learn to drive?

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.480
-10分钟前  -没到10分钟吧
- Ten minutes ago. - I thought it was less than that.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.450
-车顶关不上  -车门打不开
- The top doesn't close. - The door won't open.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.870
我们困住了
Wait! We're stuck!

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.610
一定出得去  放心
We'll get out of here. I’ll take care of it.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.210
重要的是  你别淋湿了
The important thing is that you don't get wet.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.540
挡上点
Cover yourself with this.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.960
拿着  我们走
Take it. We'll get out of here now.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.960
有我呢  放心
I’ll take care of everything.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.050
扶稳
Here we go.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.010
出来吧  公主
Step right out, Princess.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.940
出来吧
There! Step right out!

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:03.190
等等  有一潭水  别弄湿了你的脚
There's a huge puddle! You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.780
行
Here!

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.790
-走吧  -我们在哪
- Go ahead, Princess. - Where are we?

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.880
在旧地重游
We've already been here.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.930
你我到过  几时
Me and you? When?

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.810
你忘了?
Don't you remember?

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.600
那晚下着雨
The night it was raining...

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.270
我用枕头给你遮雨
and I made you an umbrella out of a pillow!

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.060
夜色迷人  我托着方向盘...
It was a beautiful night. I put the steering wheel on my shoulder...

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.280
翩翩起舞  舞至你面前
did a little waltz, and when I stopped in front of you...

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.450
你赏我一吻
you kissed me.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.920
公主  后面风大  小心着凉
Princess, your behind is blowing in the wind.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.470
我只听我喜欢的人的话
It depends on the person. My pop was like that.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.720
爸爸生前  我肯听他话
He had the ability to make me do anything.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.310
他了解我  懂得和我相处
He understood me. He knew how to deal with me.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.570
我就像他膝头的小狗狗
I was like putty in his hand.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.610
从不拒绝
I always, always, always said yes.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.280
也就是说  你这个百宝箱...
So, all these treasures you're hiding,

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.250
一但打开  你就千依百顺
there is a way to open this treasure chest

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.380
从不拒绝
and always get you to say yes!

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.590
你找到适合的钥匙就行
All you need is the right key.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.000
怎样找到
And where exactly is it?

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.670
天晓得
Heaven knows.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.920
云散了
It's clearing up.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.890
你是说…
So, you were saying...

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.140
那把钥匙必定从天而降
the key that always makes you say yes has to come from heaven.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.300
对
Yes.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.230
我要试试
I’ll give it a try.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.570
说不定圣母玛莉会赏给我
lf the Virgin Mary tosses it down to me...

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.720
说不定呢
You never know.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.650
Mary  钥匙
Mary, the key!

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.660
是这把吗
Is this it?

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.370
真要回家  不吃巧克力冰激凌吗
Do you really have to go home? What about the chocolate ice cream?

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.170
-现在去吃吧  -现在不行
- Let's get it right now. - No, not now.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.420
-那要什么时候  -不知道
- Then when? - I don't know.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.540
又是天晓得
Are we going to let heaven decide that too?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.890
不要再为小事麻烦Mary了
No, leave Mary alone. Don't bother her over an ice cream!

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:08.890
什么时候吃冰激凌  不是小事  是大事
No, it's way too important. We can't decide when to have it.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.500
我一定要问她
I have to ask her.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:12.880
Mary  派人来通知
Mary, send someone to find out...

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.960
什么时候能吃上冰激凌
how long before we can have the ice cream!

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.990
七秒钟
Seven seconds!

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.830
-这是我的家  -我经过了千百次
- This is my house. – I've gone by here a thousand times.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.550
每次都自忖  谁现在住在这儿
I’ve always asked myself: Who lives there?

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.630
我想在对街开间店铺
I wanted to open my store right out front.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.920
-书店  -对  可以天天见到你
- The bookshop? - Yes. I’ll see you every day.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.340
再见
Goodbye then.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.470
你对我很好  我现在只想洗个澡
You've been so nice to me. All I want now is a hot bath.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.600
我还有句话想说
I forgot to tell you.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:45.560
说吧
Go ahead.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.150
你想像不到  我多渴望和你做爱
You can't imagine how much I feel like making love to you.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.200
但我绝不会告诉任何人  尤其是你
But I’ll never tell anyone, especially not you.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.990
除非严刑逼供  否则我绝对不说
They'd have to torture me to make me say it.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.660
说什么
Say what?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.830
说我想和你做爱
That I want to make love to you.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.290
不仅做一次  是做完又做
Not just once. Over and over again!

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.340
除非我神经错乱
But I’ll never tell you that.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.590
否则不会透露  我渴望和你做爱
I'd have to be crazy to tell you I'd even make love to you now...

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.130
现在就想做  做足一生一世
right here, for the rest of my life.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.010
又快下雨了  你还是快走吧
You'd better run or you'll get wet. It's going to rain again.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.050
公主
Princess.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.110
你湿透了
You're all wet.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.650
西装湿了就湿了吧
My suit is no big deal.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.780
帽子湿了才不舒服
It's that hat that bothers me.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.990
我要顶干帽子  哪里有呢
I need a dry hat, but where can I find one?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.820
你刚才用的方法  我有样学样
How did it go? Right, it's easy!

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.710
Mary  派人送顶干帽子给他
Mary, send someone to give my friend a dry hat.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.760
晚安  公主  再见了
Good night, Princess. Farewell.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.620
请问洗手间在哪里
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.120
直走  左手边
Straight ahead to the left.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.890
你再不起床...
If you don't get up immediately...

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.930
我在你亡父灵前发誓  再不理你
I swear on your father's deathbed I’ll never speak to you again.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.570
再也不搭理你
For the rest of my life!

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.520
我数三声
I'm going to count to three now.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.940
你再不起床  我就把你拽起来
lf you don't get up, I’ll force you to get up.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.190
一
One...

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.400
二
two...

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.650
三
and three.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.500
好孩子
Good girl.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.930
知道谁快要结婚了吗
Do you know who's getting married?

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.750
鸡蛋淋头的混蛋
Didn't I tell you? That jerk the eggs fell on!

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.050
-娶谁  -不知道
- Who's he marrying? - I don't know.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.110
新娘还未出现
But she hasn't even shown up yet.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.860
人人都在等着
Everybody's waiting.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.360
找你找得好辛苦
I've looked everywhere for you!

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.360
-你叔叔  -我叔叔
- Your uncle. - My uncle?

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.530
他出事了  跟我来
Something's happened. Come with me!

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.950
到外面  马
Outside! The horse!

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.950
什么事
What's that?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.290
那是你的马
Is that your horse?

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.130
真见鬼  上面涂着什么
What a sight! What did they write on him?

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.430
小心  犹太马
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.350
都是那班野蛮人做的好事
The usual barbarians, vandals. It's sad. What nonsense.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.350
犹太马
"Jewish horse"!

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.940
不要生气  他们只是…
Don't get upset. They just did it to...

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.600
这不是孤立的事件
They didn't do it to... They did it "to."

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.780
你要习惯一下
You'll have to get used to it, Guido.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.570
他们也会找你麻烦
They'll start with you too.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.870
找我麻烦  怎样找
With me? What could possibly happen to me?

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.530
顶多把我剥光  给我染黄  涂上...
The worst they can do is undress me, paint me yellow and write...

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
小心  犹太侍应
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.420
不说不知  原来这匹马是犹太马
I didn't even know this horse was Jewish.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.010
走吧  明早我会把马洗干净
Let's go. I’ll clean him up in the morning.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.090
牵它回马厩
Take him back to the stall.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.790
看  你前面
Look, there, in front of you!

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.830
等一下  我想给她一个惊喜
Wait. I’ll surprise her.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.020
来  我介绍Fido Giovanardi给你认识
Come with me. I'd like to introduce you to Fido Giovanardi.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.740
Lessing医生  到哪里去
Doctor Lessing! Where are you going?

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:59.580
我接到急电  要立即回柏林
Urgent telegram. I must go to Berlin immediately.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.460
-为什么拿着盘花  -为你践行
- What are these flowers? - They're for your departure.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.550
我只要一枝
I’ll take just one.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.940
我会跟我妻子说  Guido送的花
I’ll take it to my wife: Guido's flower.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.850
和你交友  是人生一快
I truly enjoyed myself with you.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.850
你是一位...
You're the most ingenious...

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.270
很有才智的侍者
waiter I've ever come across.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.030
哪里  你是一位很有修养的顾客
Thank you. You're the customer with the most culture I've ever served.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.530
哪里
Thank you.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.660
再见  Lessing医生
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.870
猜猜这个谜
By the way.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.710
一提起我...
"lf you say my name...

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.510
我就消失  我是谁?
I'm not there anymore. Who am I?"

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.510
一提起我  我就消失
If you say my name, I'm not there anymore.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.020
什么  他说什么
What is it? What did he say?

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.140
谜底  沉默
"Silence!"

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:55.610
妙  一说那字  字就消失  沉默
Beautiful. If you say the word, it's not there anymore. Silence.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.450
我说的不是大都会  是乡下
I'm not talking about Berlin, in the outskirts. Imagine that!

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.750
三年级学生  听好了
Third grade. Listen to this problem.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.500
我记得这题是因为它难住过我
I remember it because it shocked me.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:12.210
国家每养一疯子  每日花4马克
A lunatic costs the state four marks a day.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.680
每养一瘸子  4.5马克
A cripple, four and a half marks.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.100
癫痫患者  3.5马克
An epileptic, three marks and a half.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:21.310
这些废人人数达30万
Considering that the average is four marks a day...

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.690
设  国家平均每人每日花4马克
and there are 300,000 patients, how much would the state save...

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.570
将他们全部除掉  可节省多少
if these individuals were eliminated?

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.700
真离谱
I can't believe this!

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.780
我也觉得离谱
That was my exact reaction.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.490
七岁小孩
I can't believe a seven-year-old child...

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.120

我捱不住了  我要把它放下
I can't take it anymore! I'm putting this down.

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:08.390
我不做  他们会怎样
I'll tell them I can't do it. What can they do to me?

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.730
会杀掉你
They'll kill you!

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:14.150
-搬去哪里  -下面
- Where does this thing go? - Down there.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.120

Good Lord! I'll never make it!

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.420
这里肯定有一万度
It's got to be 1 0,000 degrees in here!

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.330
我报名的时候
When I got there to sign up...

01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:27.870
公证说...
the referee was there and he said...

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.050
名单上没有你两父子的名字
"No, you and your son aren't on the list.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.670
你没有交报名费
You didn't pay your dues."

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.050
气得我差点晕过去
I almost fell over.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:39.680
他说  你们回家吧  我说  你才回去呢
He said, "You can go home." l said, "No, you go home!

你有没有和其他孩子玩
Did you play with the other kids?

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.300
有  但他们不懂规矩
Yes, but they don't know the rules.

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.720
他们说头奖不是坦克
They said it isn't true that first prize is a tank.

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.970
也不懂得计分
They don't know anything about the points.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.800
你不要相信他们  他们狡猾着呢
Did you fall for that? They're as sly as foxes.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.140
他们想赢你  你不要相信
They want to beat you! Are you joking?

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:19.350

I tripped while l was...

01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.400

游戏花款样多多  多到我想不起来
Every game. I don't even remember all of them.

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:53.600
我说  你们玩得太疯  累死我了
"You guys are obsessed! Stop! I'm tired!" I said.

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:54.280
Listen.

有  但我没要点心
Yes, but l didn't ask for a snack.

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:03.360
乖孩子  就是说你也得到了12分
Good boy! That means you got 12 points too!

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.950

This is what you get when you get up to 60.

我们比他分高
We got more than him.

这女兵一来就发狠
That one's new. She learned right away.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.450
门口那女兵  初来时相当好相处
The lady at the door, she seemed nice when she first came.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.370
现在变得最凶
She's the worst of all!

01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:17.830
起码她不派老妇和小孩去劳动
At least she didn't send the old ladies and children to work.

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:21.880
老妇和小孩不用劳动  但要死
They don't send old people and kids to work because they kill them!

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.840
他们被派去洗澡
One of these days they'll call them to take a shower.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.760
小朋友  洗澡啦
"Children, shower time!"

01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:30.180
其实  去的是毒气室
The truth is, they make them shower there in the gas chamber.

Where'd they find all these anvils?

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:53.250
爸爸

走开
Go away!

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.720

我们在制造...
We're making...

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:25.000
坦克

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.540
我们正在制造  还没有造完坦克的轮带
We're building the tank. We're still working on the tracks.

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:30.670
我们做得太慢
We're running slow.

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:35.090

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.610
这次可真够瞧的了
This sure is fun.

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:04.750
都脱光了
Everything!

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:07.170
全都脱光了  衣服挂在那儿
Take everything off! Hang it up there!

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.180
洗完澡可以拿回去
You'll get it back after the shower.

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:12.390
向前走
Forward!

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.610

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.890
被他们发现  我们就丧失资格啦
If they see us now it's over. We're disqualified.

01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:45.680

我还以为你是个精乖的小孩
I thought you were a sharp boy; cunning, intelligent.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.090
用人来做扣子  制肥皂  怎可能
Buttons and soap out of people? That'll be the day!

01:23:22.050 --> 01:23:23.710
你却相信
You believed that?

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:29.260
想想看  我用Bartolomeo变的肥皂洗手…
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning, l wash my hands with Bartolomeo...

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.890
真好用
a good scrub.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.640
然后  扣Francesco变的扣子吗
Then I'll button up with Francesco.

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.430
有没有可能  你说
Darn it all!

01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:37.110
Giorgio不见了
Look! l just lost Giorgio!

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:38.940
这颗纽扣像他吗
Does this look like a person?

01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:43.150
他们戏弄你  你却信以为真
Come on! They were teasing you! And you fell for it!

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:45.570
他们还说了什么
What else did they tell you?

01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:47.610
说我们会被送入火炉
That we get cooked in the oven.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:53.580
活活烧死
They burn us up in the oven.

01:23:55.010 --> 01:24:00.600
你也信了  他们说你就信吗
You fell for that too! You just eat everything up!

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.800
我听过用柴当燃料
I've heard of a wood oven...

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.510
没听过用人当燃料
but I've never seen a man oven before.

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:09.060
我是木头做的  抓这个律师去烧吧
"I'm made of wood!" "Take this lawyer!"

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:12.230
律师太湿  烧不着
"This lawyer doesn't burn. He's not dry enough.

01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:14.150
只会冒烟
Look at that smoke!"

01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:18.160
钮扣  肥皂  烧人
Buttons, soap, we get burned in the oven.

01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:20.490
别开玩笑了
Let's be serious now.

01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:23.530
我明天还要玩布袋竞赛呢
I have a bag race with the bad guys tomorrow.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.370
我不玩了  要回家去
That's enough. I want to go home.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.080
现在回去吗
Now?

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:31.170
现在回去
Right now.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.010
现在下着雨  你会淋出病的
It's raining now. You'll come down with a terrible fever!

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.050
我不管  现在就走
I don't care. Let's go.

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.180
好  你非要走的话...
All right. If you want to go...

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.270
我们走  收拾行李
I'll get our stuff and we'll leave.

01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:46.230
我们可以走
We can leave?

01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:49.860
当然  他们可以逼人留下吗
Naturally. What do you think they do, force people to stay here?

01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:52.030
好难
That'll be the day.

01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:54.860
异想天开  我们说走就走
Wouldn't that be great? Let's go. We'll pack our bags...

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:56.830
收拾好行李就走
and get out of here.

01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:00.490
可惜  我们在领先  却弃权
What a shame. We were in the lead. We're quitting. Off the list we go.

01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:05.220
那辆真坦克会被其他孩子赢去
Some other kid will win the real tank.

01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.630
已经没有其他孩子了  我是唯一的一个
There aren't any other kids. I'm the only one left.

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.420
已经没有孩子了吗  这里多着呢
There aren't any more kids? It's chock-full of them here!

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.970
在哪里
Where are they then?

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.110
都在躲着  绝不露面
They're all hiding. Nobody's supposed to see them.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.860
-都在认真玩游戏  -我不明白
- This is a serious game! – I just don't get it.

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:21.900
我们拿到了多少分
How many points do we have?

01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:24.270
差不多687分
Almost 687.

01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:26.570
告诉过你一千次了
I told you a thousand times.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.570
不过  既然要走就走吧
Let's go, though.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.460
-我们本来会赢的...  -我们会赢吗
- We're winning, but if you want-- - We're winning?

01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:33.950
我们在领先  早已经告诉你
We're first, l told you.

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.540
但你要退出  只好退出
But we'll quit if you want.

01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:39.640
我昨天才看过积分表
I saw the chart yesterday. We'll go anyway, though.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.210
拜拜  Bartolomeo  我和Joshua要走了
Bye, Bartolomeo. Joshua and I are leaving.

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:44.050
我们讨厌这地方
We're fed up here.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:47.970
坦克已经造成
The tank is done. It's ready.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.390
抹干净火嘴再开车
Clean the spark plugs off before you start it.

01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:54.220
记得要拉开油门
Open the throttle...

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.950
否则大炮会卡住轮带
otherwise the cannon will get stuck with the tracks.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.440
还有那支机枪  多么精致
And the gun. Did you see how nice it is? It came out beautiful!

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:03.240
开车前记得松刹闸
Lift the emergency brake off before you move!

01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:06.460
我和他要走了
We're going.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.250
Joshua要退出
Joshua wants to quit.

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:09.490
本来要开着坦克走的
We could have gone back with a tank soon,

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:10.950
现在却要坐巴士
but we'll take the bus today.

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:14.090
我和Joshua要走了  大家再见
Joshua and l are leaving. So long, everybody!

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.050
我们讨厌这地方
We're tired of this place.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.310
走吧  否则赶不上巴士了
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.600
走吧  Joshua
Let's go, Joshua.

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.150
我怕被雨淋湿  发高烧
It's raining. I'll come down with a terrible fever!

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:45.490
是我  爸爸呀
It's me, Pop!

01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:49.040
我有重要的话跟你说
I have to tell you something important! Come here!

01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:51.710
那小鬼头今早一直躲避我
That little rascal's been running away all morning.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.510
-真的有小孩  -二千个
- Is there really a kid? - There must be two thousand!

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.760
他们像小老鼠  到处躲
They're like mice. They hide all over the place!

01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.260
都想得到我们的坦克  停
Those creeps want our tank! Stop!

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.130
等一等
Wait.

01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:04.730
我似乎见过他
I might have spotted him.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.890
他可能在附近
I think he's nearby.

01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:11.610
不如你去查一查  我在这里等
Look. Go see if he's hiding in there. I'll wait here.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.490
替你把风
I'll keep a watch out.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:21.570
他在那里  爸爸
He's there, Pop!

01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:23.620
-什么样子的  金发吗  -嗯
- What'd he look like? Blond? - Yes.

01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:26.790
正是他  他叫Schwanz
That's him then. His name is... Schwanz.

01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:29.050
躲在里面已经三个星期了
He's been in there for three weeks.

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.590
他排第二  但我们领先
He was the runner up. We beat him, though!

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.060
迟早我会找到其他的孩子
Sooner or later, I'll find the others too.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.430
-有多少个  -密密麻麻
- How many are there? - It's swarming, l told you.

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:39.400
都躲着
They're all hidden.

01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:50.450
爸爸  看呀
Look, Pop!

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:52.080
这是个匿藏点
There's a hideout!

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.130
你  你  你  取消资格  我们走
Got ya, got ya, got ya! You're out! Let's go.

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.050
靠  她看见我们了
Holy smokes! She saw us!

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.680
我们被淘汰了吗
Are we out?

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:09.220
她过来是因为她看见了你
She's coming over for you.

01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:11.510
现在玩沉默游戏
Now it's time for the "be quiet" game.

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.730
你绝对不要吱声
You're never to speak.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.430
发誓
Swear it!

01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:18.820
-发誓啊  -我发誓
- Swear it! – I swear.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.690
他们咕噜咕噜  你反正听不懂
They all talk strange. You can't understand a word.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.400
我们过得这关  头奖就是我们的了
If we get through this, the first prize is ours.

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:30.590
所有领先的人  都要玩沉默游戏
They're rounding up everyone in first place. It's the silence game.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.870
一声都不能出  知道吗
Not a word, got it?

01:29:39.850 --> 01:29:41.510
你为什么跟小孩在这里
Why are you here with the children?

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.130
不准你和孩子交谈
Quiet! You're never to speak.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.600
我发誓不会
I swear.

01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:45.430
我有话对你说  很重要
I have to talk to you. Very important.

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:48.390
-哪里  几时  -我会打暗号  过会儿
- Where? When? – I'll signal you. Later.

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:03.020
谢谢
Thank you.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.170
我叫过你别跟小孩说话
I told you not to talk to the children.

01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:23.210
医生  内子也在这里
Doctor, my wife is here too.

01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:47.150
慢慢吃
Slowly.

01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:49.200
吃得太快不好
Eat slowly. It's bad for you.

01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:52.700
我们领先  可能早走
We're in the lead. We just might leave early.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.580
游戏提早结束
The game finishes early.

01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:58.800
我们要分外小心  不要出错
Don't make a mistake now that we're in the lead.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.210
慢慢吃
Slowly.

01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:24.740
留心听这个谜
So. Pay attention.

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:33.090
肥肥丑丑
"Fat, fat, ugly, ugly,

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.370
胆小到发黄
all yellow in reality.

01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.300
你问我  我是什么家伙
If you ask me what I am...

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.600
我会答  贱贱贱
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep.'

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.610
我一面走路  一面拉弓
Walking along l go, 'Poopoo'.

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.730
我到底是谁
Who am I? Tell me true."

01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:59.370
小鸭  对吗
A duckling, right?

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:04.340
是不是小鸭
Is it a duckling?

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.080
不是
It's not!

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.090
在维也纳的时候爸爸的一个兽医朋友出的这个谜面
A veterinarian friend of mine sent it to me from Vienna.

01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:14.970
我猜不出来
I can't send him mine...

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.150
就不能还他一个谜面
until I solve this one.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.730
我以为是...
I thought...

01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:23.150
鸭嘴兽
duck-billed platypus...

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:25.200
但鸭嘴兽不叫  贱贱贱
but it doesn't go, "Cheep, cheep, cheep."

01:34:25.450 --> 01:34:27.490
鸭嘴兽叫...
A duck-billed platypus goes...

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.790
昨晚我替你翻译成意大利话
I translated it into Italian for you last night.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.750
你认为怎样
Well, what do you say?

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:45.470
除了小鸭  我想不出什么
Everything points to a duckling.

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:49.640
帮帮忙
Help me.

01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:55.650
求求你
For heaven's sake...

01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:57.190
帮帮忙
help me.

01:34:58.410 --> 01:35:00.730
我连睡也睡不着
I can't even sleep.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.960
谜底是小鸭
It's the duckling!

01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:48.240
过来
Come here!

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.820
-我好累  -过来
- I'm tired. - Come here.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.380
我们在哪里
Where are we here?

01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:02.410
我可能走错了路
I might have taken the wrong way.

01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.500
乖孩子  睡吧  做个美梦
Good boy, sleep. Dream sweet dreams.

01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:07.970
可能现在就是个梦
Maybe it's only a dream!

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.220
我们在做梦  Joshua
We're dreaming, Joshua.

01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:13.180
明早  妈妈会摇醒我们
Tomorrow morning, Mommy will come wake us up...

01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:16.940
端来牛奶  饼干
and bring us two nice cups of milk and cookies.

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:19.530
我们先吃
First, we'll eat.

01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:22.780
然后我跟她做两三次爱
Then I'll make love to her two or three times...

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:25.690
如果我还有气力
if I can.

01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:16.220
对不起  Bartolomeo
Excuse me, Bartolomeo.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:20.850
有两军官没有报到  我觉得他们溜掉了
They've called those two officers 20 times. l bet they escaped.

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:22.430
你还听懂什么
Did you understand anything else?

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.270
即使猜也猜得七七八八
It's clear enough.

01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:27.350
快打完仗  纳粹党树倒猢狲散
The war is over. They're running all over the place.

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:29.610
货车要开到哪里
Where are those trucks going?

01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:32.450
最要紧的是别坐上去
The important thing is not to get on those trucks.

01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:34.540
满车去  空车回
They leave full and come back empty.

01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:36.320
你知道车子开到哪里吗
You know where they're going?

01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:40.670
女人呢  她们怎么了
What about the women? What's going on?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.460
我们离开这地狱吧  各散东西
Let's get out of this dump and split up.

01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:45.510
连行李也不用收拾
We don't even have to pack our bags!

01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:48.510
枪声  狗吠  吵了好几个钟头
I've been hearing only dogs and machine guns.

01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:50.760
他们想毁灭一切
They want to get rid of everything.

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:52.220
我要走了
I'm leaving.

01:39:52.690 --> 01:39:55.010
我们在Viareggio再见  合作开铁砧厂
See you in Viareggio. We'll start an anvil factory!

01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:56.940
