请坐</br>
Sit down.

16:33.210 --> 16:37.670
我以为我们两个要单独谈话</br>
Well I was under the impression that you and I would talk alone.

16:37.950 --> 16:40.740
这些人都是我的心腹  参议员</br>
I trust these men with my life, Senator.

16:41.220 --> 16:43.910
若是我要求他们离开 那就是侮辱他们</br>
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.570
这个…</br>
Well,

16:45.580 --> 16:47.970
我是无所谓但是我得告诉你</br>
it's perfectly all right with me,

16:47.980 --> 16:49.310
我是个很直率的人</br>
but I am a blunt man

16:49.320 --> 16:51.940
而我预备很坦白的对你说</br>
and I intend to speak very frankly to you.

16:51.950 --> 16:57.520
也许比从前任何一位 你遇过的参议员都要坦白</br>

17:05.900 --> 17:07.720
在雷诺还有一家</br>

17:08.200 --> 17:10.790
执照是早就有的</br>
The licences were grandfathered in,

17:10.800 --> 17:15.190
所以在赌博委员会是没有问题</br>
so there was no problem with the Gaming Commission.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.960
现在我的消息来源告诉我</br>
Now my sources tell me

17:18.970 --> 17:22.290

他们告诉我说在一周之内</br>
They tell me that, within a week,

17:25.140 --> 17:27.630
你就会把他们给扫地出门了</br>
you're going to move Klingman out.

17:28.110 --> 17:30.070
那是个不小的扩充</br>
Quite an expansion.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.400
不过你会遇到一个 技术上的问题</br>
However, it will leave you with a little technical problem.

17:36.610 --> 17:40.180
执照依然是克灵门的名字</br>
The licence will still be in Klingman's name.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.530
谭波是个好人</br>
Turnbull is a good man.

17:42.540 --> 17:45.470
好了  我们废话少说</br>
Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.700
我不想在这里浪费许多时间</br>
I don't want to spend more time here than I have to.

17:48.710 --> 17:51.010
你可以拥有执照</br>
You can have the licence.

17:51.020 --> 17:54.040
代价是25万</br>
The price is 250,000 dollars.

17:54.050 --> 17:56.950
加上每个月总收入的5%</br>
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly,

17:56.960 --> 18:02.020
柯里昂先生 我是指四家旅馆合并的总收入</br>
of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.

18:04.960 --> 18:09.180
现在执照的价格不超过二万元</br>
The price for the licence is less than 20,000 dollars,

18:09.190 --> 18:11.360
-我说的对不对? -没错</br>
-Am I right? -That's right.

18:12.270 --> 18:15.120
那我为何要付 这么高的价格呢?</br>
Why would I pay more than that?

18:15.130 --> 18:17.890
因为我意图要压迫你</br>
Because I intend to squeeze you.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.390
我不喜欢你这一类的人</br>
I don't like your kind of people.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.470
我不喜欢看到你油头粉面</br>
I don't like to see you come out to

18:25.470 --> 18:28.830
穿着那纯丝的西装</br>
this clean country in oily hair,dressed up in those silk suits

18:28.840 --> 18:32.570
假装是位正直的美国人</br>
and try to pass yourselves off as decent Americans.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.590
我是和你做生意</br>
I'll do business with you,

18:34.600 --> 18:38.840
但事实上我鄙视你的假面具</br>
but the fact is that I despise your masquerade,

18:38.850 --> 18:41.900
和你那种不择手段 向上爬的做事方式</br>
the dishonest way you pose yourself.

18:41.910 --> 18:44.580
你和你他妈的整个家族</br>
Yourself, and your whole fucking family.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.240
参议员</br>
Senator...

18:54.620 --> 18:57.390
我们两个都是伪善的人</br>
...we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.010
但是永远也不要想 把我的家族拿来混为一谈</br>
But never think it applies to my family.

19:03.220 --> 19:09.760
好吧! 有些人就是喜欢玩点小把戏</br>
All right, all right.Some people have to play little games.

19:09.790 --> 19:11.490
你玩你的</br>
You play yours.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.220
让我们这样说好了!</br>
Let's say that

19:15.230 --> 19:18.520
你是为了自己本身的利益 而付钱给我</br>
you'll pay me because it's in your interest.

19:18.630 --> 19:21.790
明天中午前我要你的答覆和钱</br>
I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.540
还有一件事你不要再连络我了 永远不要</br>
One more thing.Don't you contact me again,ever.

19:26.570 --> 19:29.770
从今以后  你与罪犯去打交道</br>
From now on you deal with Turnbull.

...and doesn't eat in Miami...

30:47.740 --> 30:49.670
去他的海门罗斯</br>
...with Hyman Roth!

30:56.070 --> 31:00.240
法兰克  你是个老好人 我喜欢你</br>
You're a good old man, and I like you.

31:00.710 --> 31:03.570
多年来你一直对我父亲忠诚</br>
You were loyal to my father for years.

31:04.450 --> 31:08.830
罗萨多兄弟在抓人质</br>
The Rosato brothers are taking hostages.

31:09.650 --> 31:12.920
还有  麦克! 他已经把口水吐在我脸上</br>
They spit right in my face,

31:13.120 --> 31:15.810
全因为迈阿密 那犹太人在支持着</br>
all because they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

31:15.820 --> 31:17.180
我知道</br>
I know.

31:17.190 --> 31:18.780
那就是我不要你惹他们的原因</br>
That's why I don't want them touched.

31:18.790 --> 31:20.450
-你不要我惹他们 -不要!</br>
- Not touched? - No

31:20.460 --> 31:22.110
我要你对他们公平点!</br>
I want you to be fair with them.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.850
你要我对他们公平点?</br>
You want me to be fair with them?

31:25.250 --> 31:29.550
天!你对禽兽如何公平? 汤姆!看在老天的份上</br>
How can you be fair to animals?

31:29.560 --> 31:31.950
听我说  他们吸纳西班牙人</br>
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,

31:31.960 --> 31:33.990
他们吸纳黑人</br>
they recruit niggers.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.990
他们在他们祖母的 邻近地区使用暴力</br>
They do violence in their grandmothers'neighbourhoods!

31:38.000 --> 31:44.360
且我告诉你  他们所有的勾当 都跟妓女和贩毒有关</br>
And everything with them is whores! And junk, dope!

31:44.370 --> 31:46.900
他们把赌放在最后一位</br>
And they leave the gambling to last.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.860
我要管理我自己的家族</br>
I want to run my family

31:48.870 --> 31:50.260
不需要你在背后支持</br>
without you on my back.

31:50.270 --> 31:53.830
-而我要那些罗萨多兄弟的命 -不行</br>
-and I want those Rosato brothers dead! - No.

31:53.970 --> 31:55.570
要!</br>
Mort'

32:00.880 --> 32:04.200
现在我和海门罗斯 有重要的生意要做</br>
Now I have business that's important with Hyman Roth.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.340
我不要被骚扰</br>
I don't want it disturbed.

32:07.610 --> 32:11.000
你对犹太人的忠诚 远胜过对自己的血源</br>
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew before your own blood.

32:13.810 --> 32:15.130
别这样  法兰克</br>
Come on, Frankie,

32:15.140 --> 32:17.830
你知道家父和海门罗斯 做过生意</br>
You know my father did business with Hyman Roth.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.210
他很尊重他们</br>
He respected him.

32:19.220 --> 32:21.610
令尊和海门罗斯做过生意</br>
Your father did business with Hyman Roth,

32:21.620 --> 32:24.140
令尊尊重海门罗斯</br>
he respected Hyman Roth,

32:24.150 --> 32:27.110
但他从来不信任海门罗斯</br>
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

32:27.120 --> 32:30.140
或是他的西西里人信差 强尼欧拉</br>
or his Sicilian messenger boy Johnny Ola.

32:30.150 --> 32:37.520
对不起  我先告退了 我有点累  又有点醉了</br>
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk!

32:38.390 --> 32:40.950
而且我要这的每一位都知道</br>
I want everybody here to know,

32:40.960 --> 32:43.980
我不会为各位添任何的麻烦</br>
there's not going to be no trouble from me!

32:43.990 --> 32:45.990
柯里昂阁下</br>
Don Corleone.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.620
奇契  开门</br>
Cicci, the door...

32:56.370 --> 32:58.190
你要他们现在离开吗?</br>
You want him to leave now?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.830
让他们回纽约去吧</br>
Let him go back to New York.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.730
我已经拟好我的计划了</br>
I've already made my plans.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.010
那老头酒喝的太多了</br>
The old man had too much wine.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.100
时候不早了</br>
It's late.

33:27.490 --> 33:28.870
胎儿好吗?</br>
How's the baby?

33:29.580 --> 33:31.510
在我体内睡着了</br>
Sleeping inside me.

33:32.550 --> 33:34.010
你觉得是个男孩吗?</br>
Does it feel like a boy?

33:34.020 --> 33:37.190
是的  是个男孩  麦克</br>
Yes, it does, Michael.

33:39.490 --> 33:40.850
凯</br>
Kay?

33:41.450 --> 33:43.880
我很抱歉今天这些人来</br>
I'm sorry about all the people today.

33:44.090 --> 33:48.020
时机不对 但是我也无能为力</br>
Bad timing.It couldn't be helped, though.

33:48.330 --> 33:51.320
它让我想到你以前告诉过我</br>
It made me think of what you once told me.

33:53.670 --> 33:57.980
五年内柯里昂家族事业 完全合法化</br>
"In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate."

33:57.990 --> 34:00.600
那是七年前的事了</br>
That was seven years ago.

34:03.270 --> 34:04.930
我知道</br>
I know.

34:05.470 --> 34:08.390
我在尽力  亲爱的</br>
I'm trying, darling.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.830
(你喜欢吗?爸爸)</br>
"Do you like it"

35:10.900 --> 35:12.560
你看过这个了吗?</br>
Did you see this?

35:27.470 --> 35:29.740
麦克  窗帘为何是开着的?</br>
Michael,why are the drapes open?

35:57.120 --> 35:59.110
-凯  你还好吗? -我还好</br>
Kay, are you all right?

35:59.120 --> 36:01.080
-你有没有中弹? -没有</br>
- Are you hit? - No.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.850
过去了!…</br>
It's over It's over.

36:08.190 --> 36:10.520
把门关起来!</br>
Get the door locked!

36:11.500 --> 36:13.890
停住!…</br>
Stop,stop...

36:24.200 --> 36:25.630
他们还在这里面</br>
They're still on the property.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.930

37:54.810 --> 37:56.340

38:03.650 --> 38:05.170
麦克  你还好吗?</br>
Mike, are you all right?

38:05.180 --> 38:07.180
-没事 -很好</br>
- Yeah.

38:10.730 --> 38:12.960
有许多事我不能告诉你</br>
Yeah,there's a lot I can't tell you.

38:15.230 --> 38:17.150
我知道过去你因此而很颓丧</br>
and I now that's upset you in the past.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.890
是有点儿</br>
A little.

38:19.730 --> 38:23.750
你觉得那表示缺少信任与信心</br>
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.590
但那是…</br>
But it's...

38:26.600 --> 38:30.130
是因为我钦佩你而且我爱你</br>
because I admire you and love you,

38:30.140 --> 38:32.900
所以我才对你保守秘密</br>
that I kept things secret from you.

38:34.640 --> 38:39.030
也因此在这个时候 你是我唯一能信任的人</br>
Now you're the only one I can trust.

38:40.510 --> 38:42.240
弗雷多?</br>
Fredo?

38:42.440 --> 38:44.670
他有个善良的心</br>
Well, he's got a good heart.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.530
但是他很懦弱而且很笨</br>
But he's weak and he's stupid

38:47.540 --> 38:50.280
而这是生死攸关的事</br>
nd this is life and death.

38:50.450 --> 38:54.100
汤姆!你是我的兄弟</br>
Tom, you're my brother.

38:59.490 --> 39:05.080
我一直希望你把我当成你兄弟 像亲兄弟一样</br>
I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

39:07.160 --> 39:08.950

你要接管一切</br>
You're going to take over.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.210

39:26.930 --> 39:29.090

39:31.930 --> 39:36.360
包括弗雷多及他的手下 还有罗可  纳利所有人</br>
Over Fredo and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

39:37.740 --> 39:41.270
我把我太太的性命交付给你</br>
I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife

39:41.300 --> 39:43.120
还有我的孩子</br>
and my children,

39:43.170 --> 39:45.090
以及这个家族的未来</br>
the future of this family.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.430
若是我们抓到这些傢伙</br>
If we catch them,

39:49.440 --> 39:51.660
你看有否可能查出 幕后主使者吗?</br>
will we find out...

39:51.670 --> 39:53.640
没必要去抓</br>
We won't catch them.

39:54.670 --> 39:55.960
除非我错的离谱</br>
Unless I'm very wrong,

39:55.970 --> 39:58.010
否则他们应该已经死了</br>
they're dead already.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.370
被一位很接近我们的人杀死</br>
They were killed by somebody close to us.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.740
是内奸</br>
Inside.

40:04.750 --> 40:08.240
非常怕会曝光</br>
Very,very frightened that they botched it.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.640
那么你的人呢?罗可和纳利</br>
You don't think that Rocco and Neri

40:10.650 --> 40:12.820
你不会认为他们与此事有关吧</br>
had something to do with this?

40:15.990 --> 40:17.510
你知道吗?</br>
See...

40:17.520 --> 40:20.760
我们的人都是生意人</br>
All our people are businessmen.

40:21.850 --> 40:24.750
他们的忠诚是以那个为基础</br>
Their loyalty is based on that.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.960
我由爸爸那里学到了一点</br>
One thing I learned from Pop...

40:31.270 --> 40:35.720
试着想想你身边的人 会怎么想?</br>
...was to try to think as people around you think.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.760
在生意的基础上 凡事都有可能</br>
On that basis, anything is possible.

40:41.560 --> 40:45.520
他们死在那里 就在我窗户外面</br>
Mike, they're dead! Right outside my window!

40:45.530 --> 40:48.890
我要离开这里  否则死的是我</br>

Looks like they were hired out of New York.

41:04.650 --> 41:06.610
我不认识他们</br>
I don't recognise them.

41:07.580 --> 41:09.070

Won't get anything out of them now.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.460

It was on my pillow.

42:57.530 --> 42:58.720

她非常美  你必须见见她</br>

听我说  我没有你那种脑筋</br>
I don't have your brain

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.060
去做那些大生意</br>

但这是市井之事</br>

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:38.860
那个迈阿密的海门罗斯 他在支持那些王八蛋</br>

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.390
那么是为什么?</br>
Then why?

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.510
为何你要求我与他们谈和? 麦克</br>

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.410
是海门罗斯叫人杀我的</br>

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.510
趁我们还有力量之前 现在就去</br>

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.490
这里以前是家父的书房</br>

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160
在这有张大桌子</br>

当我还是孩子之时 在这附近玩耍都要很小声</br>
I remember when I was a kid. We had to be quiet when we played near here.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.630
我很高兴这幢房子 始终不曾落入陌生人的手里</br>

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:46.970
先是克里曼沙接手  现在是你</br>

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.080
家父在这里教了我许多事情</br>

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.080
就在这间房间里教我的</br>

他教我与朋友保持接近</br>
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.920
但是敌人要更接近</br>
but your enemies closer."

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:06.550
现在若是海门罗斯看到 我出面协调这件事</br>
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.950
帮了罗萨多兄弟的忙</br>
in the Rosato brothers' favour

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:12.320
他会认为与我的关然依然良好</br>
he'll think his relationship with me is still good.

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:15.560
-明白吗? -明白</br>
-Capide? -Capide.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.860
我就是要他那样想</br>
That's what I want him to think.

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:20.860
我要他们完全的放松</br>
I want him relaxed

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:23.660
对我们的友谊有绝对的信心</br>
and confident in our friendship.

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.130
那我就能查出来</br>
Then I'll be able to find out

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.060

Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:20.920
-他会一个人来吗? -我什么都不知道</br>
- Will he come alone?-I don't know.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:22.630
你们使我陷的够深了</br>
You've got me in deep enough already.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.990
只是一起去</br>
Just go along,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.440

那东西一定是假的</br>
It's got to be fake.

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.500
不是假的  那是真的 所以才叫他超人</br>

注意看!他要把那打碎了</br>

依我的判断你能继续你的目标</br>
And in my judgment, you'll continue to get those,

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.120
因为我不相信</br>
because I don't believe

01:40:49.130 --> 01:40:52.230
艾森豪总统会撤出古巴</br>
that President Eisenhower well ever pull out of Cuba

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.560
只要我们在古巴 有超过十亿美金的投资</br>
not as long as we have over one billion dollars

01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:56.430
他就不会撤走</br>
invested in this country.

01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:12.340
我们要在这停留多久?</br>
How long should we stay?

01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:13.640
我不知道</br>

01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:15.470
我想半个小时就可以了</br>
I think a half hour ought to do it.

你伤了我的心!</br>
You broke my heart.

你伤了我的心!</br>
You broke my heart!

鉴于我们的部队在关达那摩 及圣地牙哥严重的挫败</br>
Due to serious setbacks to our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago

01:44:55.410 --> 01:44:59.540
我在古巴的地位已经动摇</br>

六百元</br>
600 bucks.

01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:45.910
若是我们不付呢?</br>
Suppose we don't pay?

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:48.310
你知道他们那帮人，泰西欧</br>
You know his gang, Tessio.

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.970
真正的野兽!</br>
Real animals.

01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:53.250
马朗萨拉让范伦奇在这一带混</br>
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood.

01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.750
而且他与条子有来往!</br>

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.450
我们必须付给他</br>
We have to pay him.

01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:01.660
每人二百元  大家同意吗?</br>
$200 each...everybody agreed?

01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:07.150
我们干嘛得付给他?</br>
Why do we have to pay him?

01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:10.430
维多  这件事交给我们</br>
Vito, leave this to us.

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.760
他只有一个人  我们有三个</br>
He's one person, we're three.

01:53:13.770 --> 01:53:17.060
他有枪  我们也有枪</br>
He's got guns, we've got guns.

01:53:17.070 --> 01:53:20.290
为何要将我们的血汗钱送给他</br>
Why should we give him the money we sweated for?

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:24.200
这里是他的地盘</br>
This is his neighborhood!

01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:30.110
我认识两个不付钱给范伦奇的</br>
I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci.

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:38.270
他们不付钱给范伦奇</br>
They don't pay Fanucci.

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.940
若他们不付钱给范伦奇</br>
If they don't pay Fanucci

01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:43.970
就是另外有人为马朗萨拉去收</br>
then somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:48.410
我们若付他钱 他就不会再缠我们了</br>
We'll all be better off if we pay him.

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:50.060
别担心</br>
Don't worry.

01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:07.320
我现在说的仅止于这个房间</br>
Now what I say stays in this room.

01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:09.330
若是你们俩愿意</br>
If you both like

01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:13.800
为何不每人给我50元付范伦奇</br>
why not give me $50 each to pay Fanucci?

01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:19.760
我保证他会接受我付给他的</br>
I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.830
若是范伦奇说二百元</br>
If Fanucci says $200

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.830
他就是要那么多  维多</br>
he means it, Vito!

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:28.000
我会和他讲道理</br>
I'll reason with him.

01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:33.440
把事情交给我吧!</br>
Leave everything to me.

01:54:33.450 --> 01:54:35.470
我会料理一切的</br>
I'll take care of everything.

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:40.550
我从不对我的朋友说谎</br>
I never lie to my friends.

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.340
明天你们俩都去和范伦奇谈</br>
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:46.640
他会要那笔钱</br>
He'll ask for the money.

01:54:46.650 --> 01:54:51.450
告诉他你们会如数奉上</br>
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants.

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:53.250
别和他争论</br>
Don't argue with him.

01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:55.050
然后我会去让他同意</br>
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

01:54:55.060 --> 01:55:02.150
既然他那么强硬  别和他争论</br>
Don't argue with him, since he's so tough.

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.890
你怎么可能让他少拿点?</br>
How can you get him to take less?

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:07.190
那是我的事</br>
That's my business.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:11.630
只要记得我帮了你们一个忙</br>
Just remember that I did you a favor.

01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:19.540
-一言为定? -好</br>
-Is it a deal? -Si.

01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.180
干杯!</br>
Salute.

01:55:27.190 --> 01:55:29.410
干杯!</br>
Salute.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.430
他的家人出去了</br>
His family's out of the house.

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:11.760
范伦奇一个人在咖啡厅里</br>
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.200
维多  这是我的50元</br>
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.

01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:34.740
维多!你确定他会收吗?</br>
Buona fortuna,are you sure he's going to go for it?

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.480
我会让范伦奇不能拒绝</br>
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.

01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:42.260
别担心</br>
Don't worry.

01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:21.280
看起来我帽子下有一百元</br>
It looks like there's - $100 under my hat.

01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:37.940
我说对了  只有一百元</br>
I was right.Only $100...

01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:43.920
我目前缺钱用</br>
I'm short of money right now.

01:57:43.930 --> 01:57:49.420
我失业了  给我一点时间</br>
I've been out of work,so just give me a little time.

01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:52.790
你了解的  对吧?</br>
You understand, don't you?

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:04.500
你有胆量  年轻人</br>
You've got balls, young man!

01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:08.560
我以前为何没听到你的名字?</br>
How come I never heard of you before?

01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:18.330
你非常有胆量</br>
You've got a lot of guts.

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:24.510
我会帮你找份赚大钱的工作</br>
I'll find you some work for good money.

01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:40.020

这对我来说太暴力了</br>
Oh, this is too violent for me!

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:27.050

What've you got there?

麦克  爸爸非常的爱你</br>

-你是说你杀人 -我什么?</br>

你服从上级的命令去杀人</br>
You kill people at the behest of your superiors.

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.290

你是否能回答得更详细</br>

奇契先生 你也许觉得这很好玩</br>
You may find this very amusing,

但我告诉你 委员会的成员不这么想</br>

02:11:48.090 --> 02:11:53.510
告诉我  妈  在父亲内心深处 他想些什么?</br>

为他的家庭而坚强</br>

可是为他的家坚强以外</br>
But by being strong for his family

02:12:22.110 --> 02:12:27.800
他会不会失去它?</br>
could he lose it?

02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:32.430
你在想你太太及失去的孩子</br>
You're thinking about your wife about the baby you lost.

02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:40.740
但你与你太太都还能再生孩子</br>

02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:46.920
不  我是说…失去他的家</br>

柯伦波太太 你找我有什么事?</br>

02:13:59.250 --> 02:14:05.510
你太太叫我来问你是否能帮我</br>
Your wife told me to ask if you could help me.

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.210

02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:12.410
他的邻居向房东抱怨她的狗</br>

02:14:13.550 --> 02:14:16.510
他叫她把动物丢掉</br>

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:20.050
但她的小儿子爱那条狗</br>
But her little boy loves that dog.

02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.620
所以她留下了它</br>
So she hid it.

02:14:22.630 --> 02:14:25.180
但当房东发现之后</br>
When the landlord found out

02:14:25.190 --> 02:14:27.220
他很生气  叫她搬走</br>
he got mad and told her to leave.

02:14:27.230 --> 02:14:32.360
现在即使她把狗送走 也无法住下去了</br>
Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it.

02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:34.630
我好惭愧</br>
I'm so ashamed!

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:41.020
他说要叫警察把我们扔到街上</br>

02:14:46.070 --> 02:14:49.830

I want you to talk to him!

告诉他我希望住在这里</br>
Tell him I want to stay here!

What's your landlord's name?

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:10.110

他住在第四街  离这很近</br>

他们打破窗户  弄脏地板</br>
They break the windows, they dirty the floors...

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:19.510

她说没有正当理由 就要赶她搬家</br>

02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:50.890
她是个穷寡妇  没人照料她</br>
She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her.

02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:54.130
她没有亲人  没有钱</br>
She has no relatives,no money.

02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:55.690
她所有的只是这一带的邻居</br>
All she has is this neighborhood.

02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:59.660
我已经把那地方租给别人家了</br>
I already rented the place to another family.

02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.960
我告诉过她我会和你谈谈</br>
I told her that I'd talk to you.

02:16:06.970 --> 02:16:10.140

让她留下来吧!</br>

02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:27.410
我们实际上是同乡 帮我一个忙</br>
We're practically paesani, do me this favor.

02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:32.380
我已经租出去了  反悔的话 我会看起来像个白痴</br>
I already rented it! I'll look like an idiot.

02:16:32.390 --> 02:16:34.280
而且新房客的房租要高一些</br>
Besides, the new tenants pay more rent.

02:16:34.290 --> 02:16:37.080

这里是先付六个月的涨价租金</br>

但别告诉她  她的自尊心很强</br>
But don't tell her about it. She's very proud.

02:16:50.690 --> 02:16:53.690
六个月到了再来找我</br>
Come see me in another six months.

02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.260

小心我把你那 西西里屁股踢上街</br>
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street!

02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:20.560
帮我一个忙  我不会忘记的</br>
Do me this favor.I won't forget it.

02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:24.900
向你这一带的朋友打听我</br>

02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:32.520
他们会告诉你  我会回报的</br>

02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:37.070

他在哪诞生?</br>
Where was he born?

02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:59.440
西西里的柯里昂村</br>
Corleone, Sicily.

02:20:59.450 --> 02:21:01.740
他是否有时会使用别号</br>
Did he at times use an alias

02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:05.770
就是别人所说的"教父"</br>
that was known in certain circles as Godfather?

02:21:06.310 --> 02:21:09.870
教父是他朋友对他的称呼</br>
Godfather is a term used by his friends.

02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:13.110
是种内心的感受与对他的尊敬</br>
One of affection and respect.

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:14.480
主席先生!</br>
Mr. Chairman

02:21:14.490 --> 02:21:17.840
我想证实证人的陈词</br>
I would like to verify the witness' statement.

02:21:17.850 --> 02:21:22.910
多年来我的选民中 意大利人后裔不断增加</br>
For years many of my constituents have been of Italian descent.

02:21:23.130 --> 02:21:25.450
而我蛮了解他们</br>
I've come to know them well.

02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:30.210
他们以支持及友谊来荣耀我</br>
They have honoured me with their support and their friendship.

02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:31.680
我可以很骄傲的说</br>
I can proudly say

02:21:31.690 --> 02:21:36.120
我的一些要好的朋友中 有不少是美籍意大利人</br>
that some of my very best friends are Italian-Americans.

02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:41.750
主席先生  在这个重要时刻 我必须离席</br>
However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I have to leave these proceedings

02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:44.550
去参加我的委员会</br>
in order to preside over a very important meeting

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:46.730
主持一个极重要的会议</br>
of my own committee.

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:50.160
但在我离开之前 我要说明这个</br>
Before I leave, I do want to say this

02:21:50.170 --> 02:21:54.660
这次关于黑手党的听证会 不管怎么样</br>
that these hearings on the Mafia are in no way whatsoever

02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:57.290
都对意大利人是一种侮辱</br>
a slur upon the great Italian people.

02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:00.590
因为根据我自己的 经验与知识我可以断定</br>
I can state from my own knowledge and experience

02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:05.830
美国公民中 最忠贞爱国苦干的人</br>
that Italian-Americans are among the most loyal,most law-abiding,

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:10.130
美籍意大利人是其中的一分子</br>
patriotic, hard-working American citizens in this land.

02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:15.440
若我们让一粒老鼠屎 坏了一锅粥的话</br>
It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman

02:22:15.450 --> 02:22:18.100
那会是很可惜的  主席先生</br>
if we allowed a few rotten apples to give a bad nameto the whole barrel.

02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:20.870
因为由历史上 伟大的哥伦布时代开始</br>
ecause from the time of Christopher Columbus

02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:23.550
经过了文艺复兴直到目前</br>
to the time of Enrico Fermi

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:30.540
美籍意大利人一直是我们国家的 前锋与护卫者</br>
Italian-Americans have been pioneers in building and defending our nation.

02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:32.410
他们是土地之盐</br>
They are the salt of the earth

02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:35.520
也是这国家的支柱之一</br>
and one of the backbones of this country.

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:39.450
这边</br>
Here,

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:41.780
这边…</br>
Here...

02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:45.420
我想大家都同意我们同僚的话</br>
I think we all agree with our esteemed college.

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:46.710
柯里昂先生</br>
Now,Mr. Corleone

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:49.820
你已经被知会了你的法律权益</br>
you have been advised as to your legal rights.

02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:52.080
我们有一位证人的证词</br>
We have testimony

02:22:52.090 --> 02:22:53.350

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.390
-你是吗? -不  我不是</br>
- Are you? - No, I'm not.

02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:06.920
证人指证你要对1947年 纽约市警官的谋杀案</br>
He testified that you are personally responsible

02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:12.290
及与他一起被杀的 威尔斯索拉索</br>
for the murder of a New York police captain in 1947

02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:14.500
负完全的责任</br>
and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.

02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:17.130
-你否认吗? -是的  我否认</br>
- Do you deny this? - Yes, I do.

02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:22.340
1950年时你是否策划杀害</br>
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder

02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:26.000
所谓纽约市五大家族的老大</br>
of the heads of the "Five Families" in New York

02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:29.680
以稳固你独霸的情况</br>
who assume and consolidate your nefarious power?

02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:31.940
这完全是假的  先生</br>
It's a complete falsehood.

02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:33.210
奎斯特先生</br>
Mr. Questadt.

02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:38.100
你是否拥有 拉斯维加斯三间主要旅馆</br>
Is it true you have a controlling interest in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:39.940
不  不是真的!</br>
No, it's not true.

02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:42.640
我拥有一些那里旅馆的股票</br>
I own some stock in some of the hotels there

02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:44.250
但数量很少</br>
but very little.

02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:51.040
我也有IBM 及电话电报公司的部分股票</br>
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:52.180

02:23:56.490 --> 02:23:59.820

02:23:59.830 --> 02:24:02.410
参议员  我的委托人想要…</br>
Senator, my client would like

02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:03.620
在这委员会面前发表一篇声明</br>
to read a statement.

02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:04.820
主席先生!</br>
Mr. Chairman

02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:07.190
主席先生!我认为这篇声明</br>
Mr. Chairman,I think this statement is

02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:09.390
以目前来说是完全不合时宜的</br>
totally out of order at this time.

02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:12.430
先生  我的委托人 很诚心诚意的</br>
Sir, my client has answered

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:13.690
回答了这委员会每一个问题</br>
this committee's questions with sincerity.

02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:17.260
他虽有权引用</br>
He hasn't taken

02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:18.800
但他并没有用 宪法第五修正案来回避</br>
the Fifth Amendment

02:24:18.810 --> 02:24:20.130
为了公平起见</br>
so this statement

02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:21.960
我们认为这篇声明该被听到</br>
should be heard!

02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:26.700
不  我允许柯里昂先生 读出他的声明</br>
No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read his statement.

02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:28.770
我会把它列入记录</br>
I'll put it in the record.

02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:32.910
为了希望澄清我家庭的名声</br>
In the hopes of clearing my family name

02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:35.400
怀着真挚的愿望想给我的孩子</br>
to give my children their

02:24:35.410 --> 02:24:37.300
公平的享受一个美国式的生活</br>
share of the American way of life

02:24:37.310 --> 02:24:40.140
使他们的姓氏和背景 不用背负恶名</br>
without a blemish on their name and background

02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:45.870
我出席这委员会 并尽可能的合作</br>
I have appeared before this committee and given it all my cooperation.

02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:52.510
我必须否认我是罪犯 那对我而言是极为不荣誉</br>
I consider it a great personal dishonour to have to deny that I am a criminal.

02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.480
我希望以下几点列入记录中</br>
I wish to have the following noted for the record:

02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:58.810
在第二次世界大战时</br>
That I served my country faithfully

02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.280
我忠心及荣耀的 为我的国家服务</br>
in World War Two and was awarded

02:25:01.290 --> 02:25:03.640
我因保卫我国家的行动</br>

我从来没有因任何罪名 被捕或定罪</br>
That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime.

02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:15.390
没有任何证据 使我牵连到犯罪阴谋中</br>
That no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy

02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:18.760
不管是黑手党或是同乡帮</br>
whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra

02:25:18.770 --> 02:25:22.890
或任何你们想加诸于我的 众所皆知的罪名</br>
or any other name has ever been made public.

02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:26.130
虽然有权利这么做</br>
I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment

02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:28.330
但我并未以第五修正案 作护身符</br>
although I may do so.

02:25:31.170 --> 02:25:33.420
我向这委员会挑战</br>
I challenge this committee

02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:36.700
请他们提出任何 不利于我的人证或物证</br>
to produce any witness or evidence against me

02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:38.830
若是他们无法提出</br>
and if they do not

02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:41.560
我希望他们以相同情况</br>
I hope they will have the decency

02:25:41.570 --> 02:25:44.800
在大众面前洗清我的名声</br>
to clear my name with the same publicity

02:25:44.810 --> 02:25:47.300
他们现在已完全的 破坏了我的名声</br>
with which they have besmirched it.

02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:50.840
柯里昂先生  我确信我们 都留下了深刻的印象</br>
I'm sure we're all quite impressed.

02:25:50.850 --> 02:25:53.340
尤其是你对国家的爱</br>

02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:01.410
以确定今天对你提出的控诉</br>
who'll corroborate the charges against you.

02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:03.040
当时候到了  柯里昂先生</br>
And at which time Mr.Corleone.

02:26:03.050 --> 02:26:06.440
你非常可能会被证明有罪</br>
you may very well be subject to indictment for perjury.

02:26:06.450 --> 02:26:11.270
我提醒你  你必须随传随到 柯里昂先生  休会</br>
I remind you that you're still under subpoena.Adjourned!

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.750
十比一  十比一的机会 你说的</br>
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:19.450
十比一的机会</br>
Ten-to-one shot

02:26:19.460 --> 02:26:22.780
他会采用第五修正案 而我输了</br>
He would take the Fifth, and I lose.

02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:24.950
你听起来像是我的赌马经纪人</br>
You sound like my bookie.

02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:27.390
我欠那傢伙一条命</br>
I owe that monkey my life.

02:26:28.570 --> 02:26:30.420
你最好是好好睡一觉</br>
Well, just get a good night's sleep.

02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:32.020

明天我会亲自给你刮胡子</br>
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:44.160
在你五千万名美国同胞面前</br>
You'll look respectable for 50 million

02:26:44.170 --> 02:26:46.230
你会看起来很体面</br>
of your fellow Americans.

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:51.670

有些事我想和你谈谈</br>

我想改变已经太迟了  麦克</br>
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.410
我答应我自己不说什么</br>
I wasn't going to say anything...

02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:10.980
-但现在… -你说太迟是什么意思?</br>
-but now...- What do you mean, "too late"?

02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:19.440
潘坦居利究竟发生了何事? 麦克</br>

02:39:24.660 --> 02:39:26.850
他哥哥来了</br>
His brother came and helped him.

在飞机上  回西西里去了</br>

他只要露个脸就行了</br>

02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:45.850
和我无关</br>
I had nothing to do with it.

02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:56.500
没人可以走  你不行 孩子们也不行</br>
Don't tell me you're going, Not you, not the kids

02:39:56.510 --> 02:40:00.560
你听到没?你是我的太太 他们是我的孩子</br>
No,You're my wife and my children

02:40:00.570 --> 02:40:02.600
我爱你  我不允许  就是这样</br>

男人跟女人之间 总是不断的有事发生</br>

02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:10.730
那是永远不变的  如此而已</br>

02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:13.200
-麦克!…你变得盲目了 -对什么盲目?</br>
-You've become blind! -Blind to what?

02:40:13.210 --> 02:40:14.900

02:40:29.290 --> 02:40:31.080
结束了</br>
Over!

02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:48.290
在这一刻  我对你毫无爱意</br>
At this moment I feel no love for you at all.

02:40:48.330 --> 02:40:51.520
我从没想到那会发生</br>
I never thought that would ever happen

02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:54.500
但发生了</br>
but it has.

02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:09.170

02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:18.530
凯  你为何不带孩子回房去</br>
Why don't you take the kids back to their room?

02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:20.760
麦克  你没听到我说的</br>
Michael, you haven't heard me.

02:41:20.770 --> 02:41:24.440
凯  你想要我怎么样?</br>
Kay, what do you want from me?

02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:27.270
你期望我会让你走?</br>
Do you expect me to let you go

02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:31.870
你期望我会让你 由我身边带走我的孩子?</br>
to let you take my children from me?

02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:33.210
你难道不了解我?</br>
Don't you know me?

02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:35.240
你难道不晓得那是不可能的</br>
Don't you know that

02:41:35.250 --> 02:41:37.540
那是不可能发生的</br>
that's an impossibility?

02:41:37.550 --> 02:41:42.010
你不知道我会尽全力 来阻止那件事发生?</br>
That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening?

02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:44.780
你难道不晓得吗?</br>
Don't you know that?

02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:47.950
凯</br>

02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:53.460
在这段时间后</br>

02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:00.190
你会高兴我现在阻止了你</br>
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:03.980
我晓得的</br>
I know that.

02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:09.360
我知道你因为失去胎儿而怪我</br>
I know you blame me for losing the baby.

02:42:11.230 --> 02:42:16.200
我知道那对你有何意义</br>
I know what that meant to you.

02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:20.870
我会补偿你的  凯</br>
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

我发誓我会补偿你  我…</br>

那么你就能忘了这次小产</br>
Then you'll forget about this miscarriage...

02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:41.370
我们再怀一个孩子</br>
...and we'll have another child.

02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:43.070
继续生活在一起</br>
And we'll go on, you and I.

你和我白首偕老</br>
We'll go on.

那不是小产  那是坠胎</br>

坠胎!麦克 就像我们的婚姻一样</br>

我不想要你的儿子!麦克</br>
I didn't want your son, Michael!

没有办法了  麦克</br>
There would be no way, Michael

你永远不可能原谅我</br>

连这已经延续了二千年的 西西里的传统也不行</br>

他们会把他直接交给有关单位</br>
They'll turn him over to the Internal Revenue

02:58:19.980 --> 02:58:21.730

不是不可能的</br>
It's not impossible.

没有任何事是不可能的</br>

02:58:25.180 --> 02:58:26.570

没有接近他的办法</br>
There's no way we can get to him!

02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:31.080
汤姆  你令我惊讶</br>
Tom, you surprise me.

If anything in this life is certain...

若是历史教了我们任何东西</br>

02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:43.120
那就是你可以杀任何人</br>
...it's that you can kill anyone.

若我进来时就有不对劲 你干嘛还问我?</br>
Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in?

02:59:05.740 --> 02:59:08.160
我想你会告诉我…</br>
I thought you were going to tell me

02:59:09.300 --> 02:59:12.000
你要把你家搬去拉斯维加斯</br>
that you're moving your family to Vegas

02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:17.930
有人请你去当 休斯顿饭店的副总裁</br>
and that you'd been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:20.690
-我以为你会告诉我 -我拒绝了他们</br>
- I thought you'd tell me that. -I turned them down.

02:59:20.700 --> 02:59:23.810
我得告诉你 我每次拒绝的事吗?</br>
Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

02:59:27.950 --> 02:59:30.940
-我们谈正事吧! -好吧</br>
- Let's do business. - All right.

02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:35.380
只要考虑一下  麦克 考虑一下</br>
Just consider this, Michael.Just consider it.

02:59:36.650 --> 02:59:38.970
罗斯和罗萨多兄弟 本来就在跑路了</br>
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:41.780
这值得吗?我们够强壮吗?</br>
Are they worth it, are we strong enough?

02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:43.840
是否值得?</br>
Is it worth it?

02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:47.010
我是说你赢了 你还想要干掉每一个人</br>
You've won. Do you want to wipe everybody out?

02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:50.310
我不觉得我需要干掉每一个人 汤姆</br>
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom.

02:59:50.520 --> 02:59:53.750
只有我的敌人  如此而已</br>
Just my enemies, that's all.

02:59:59.860 --> 03:00:03.450
你对我要做的事表示同意 还是另有打算?</br>
Are you with me in these things, or what?

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:05.850
因为若不同意的话</br>
Because if not

03:00:05.860 --> 03:00:08.660
你可以带着你太太  你的家人</br>
you can take your wife, your family

03:00:08.670 --> 03:00:10.430
及你的情妇</br>
and your mistress

03:00:10.530 --> 03:00:12.700
全部搬到拉斯维加斯去</br>
and move them all to Las Vegas.

你为何要伤害我?麦克</br>
Why do you hurt me, Michael?

03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:19.790
我一向对你忠心</br>
I've always been loyal to you.

03:00:19.800 --> 03:00:22.540
我是说…这是怎么一回事?</br>
What is this?

03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:28.900

- Would you like that? - Okay.

03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:49.780

You know, when I was your age...

03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:54.140
我和我所有的兄弟一起去钓鱼</br>
...I went out fishing with all my brothers

03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:58.140

03:00:58.650 --> 03:01:01.640

每一次我把钓线丢入水中时</br>

阴谋者总是保有一次机会</br>

03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:01.890
好让家族保有财富  对不对?</br>

03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:14.530
那就不会发生任何事</br>
then nothing happened.
