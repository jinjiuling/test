00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:26.980


00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:26.980


00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:26.980


00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980


00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.980


00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.980


00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980


00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.980


00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.440
勇敢的心

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.360
勇敢的心

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.680
苏格兰

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.660
公元1280年

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.680
我要讲述的是威廉·华莱士的故事
</br>I shall tell you of William Wallace.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.180
英格兰的历史学家会说我是个骗子
</br>Historians from England will say I am a liar,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.360
但历史正是由那些绞杀了英雄的人书写的
</br>but history is written by those who have hanged heroes.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.940
苏格兰国王去世时没有留下儿子
</br>The king of Scotland had died without a son,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.690
当时的英格兰国王
</br>and the king of England,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.370
残忍的异教徒  长腿爱德华
</br>a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.540
宣称自己是苏格兰国王
</br>claimed the throne of Scotland for himseIf.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.540
苏格兰贵族们奋起反抗
</br>Scotland's nobles fought him

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.000
但又为王位互相残杀
</br>and fought each other over the crown.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.170
长腿邀请贵族们进行和谈
</br>So Longshanks invited them to talks of truce,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.420
不带武器  只带一名男侍
</br>no weapons, one page only.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.600
当地有个农民叫马尔科姆·华莱士
</br>Among the farmers of that shire was Malcolm Wallace,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470
他是拥有自己土地的平民
</br>a commoner with his own lands.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.230
他有两个儿子  约翰和威廉
</br>He had two sons, John and William.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.490
我让你待在家的
</br>I told you to stay.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.030
我的活儿干完了
</br>Well, I finished my work.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.200
我们要去哪儿
</br>Where are we going?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.440
马克安得鲁家  
</br>MacAndrews'.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.490
他本该在谈判后来找我们的
</br>He was supposed to visit when the gathering was over.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.490
我能一起去吗  
</br>Can I come?

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.710
不行  回家去  孩子
</br>No. Go home, boy.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.170
但我想去
</br>But I want to go.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.920
回家去  威廉  否则你就要挨打了
</br>Go home, William, or you'll feel the back of my hand.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.170
回家去  威廉
</br>Go you home, William.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.780
马克安得鲁
</br>MacAndrews!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.290
马克安得鲁
</br>MacAndrews!

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.090
上帝啊
</br>Holy Jesus.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.050
-没事的  -威廉  威廉
</br>- It's all right! - William! William!

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.180
威廉  威廉  没事的
</br>William! William, it's all right.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.680
没事的  别怕  孩子
</br>It's all right. Easy, lad.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.200
威廉
</br>William.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.200
要我说我们立刻反击
</br>And I say we hit back now!

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.410
我们不能反抗他们  那是去送死
</br>We cannot fight them! It's suicide!

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.080
得做些什么
</br>Something's got to be done.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.880
华莱士说得对  我们要反抗
</br>Wallace is right! We fight them!

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.670
所有想要反抗的贵族都在那个会议上
</br>Every nobleman who had a will to fight was at that meeting.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.960
我们打不赢军队
</br>We cannot beat an army.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.800
只靠五十个农民没戏
</br>Not with 50 farmers.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.090
我们不用打赢  只是要反抗
</br>We do not have to beat them, just fight them.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.640
谁支持我
</br>Now, who's with me?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.680
我支持你  华莱士
</br>I am, Wallace.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.640
好吧  好吧
</br>All right, all right.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.890
就这么定了
</br>Ready.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.160
你这是想去哪儿
</br>Where do you think you're going?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.620
我要跟你一起
</br>I'm going with you.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.910
你要跟我一起吗
</br>You're going with me, are you?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.330
-那你打算做些什么  -我会帮忙
</br>- And what are you going to do? - I'm gonna help.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.670
你一定是个好帮手
</br>And a good help you'd be, too,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.550
但我需要你呆在这
</br>but I need you to stay here

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.090
在我不在时照顾好这里
</br>and look after the place for me while I'm away.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.760
我可以打仗
</br>I can fight.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.730
我知道  我知道你能打仗
</br>I know. I know you can fight.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.780
但智慧才会让我们成为男子汉
</br>But it's our wits that make us men.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.280
明天见
</br>See you tomorrow.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.070
-英格兰人  -趴下
</br>- English. - Get down.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.280
你父亲和哥哥都走了
</br>With your father and brother gone,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.240
他们会杀了我们再烧了农田
</br>they'll kill us and burn the farm.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.740
靠我们了  哈米什
</br>It's up to us, Hamish.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.470
爸
</br>Da?

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.980
爸
</br>Da?

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.260
威廉
</br>William.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.390
过来  孩子
</br>Come here, lad.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.790
耶和华啊  我从深处向你求告
</br>De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.090
主啊  求你听我的声音
</br>Domine, exaudi vocem meam.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.790
愿你侧耳
</br>Fiant aures tuae intendentes

听我恳求的声音
</br>in covem deprecationis meae.

耶和华啊  请给予他们永远的安息
</br>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.890
愿圣光永远照耀他们
</br>Et lux perpetua luceat eis.

请安息吧
</br>Requiescat in pace.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.900
阿门

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.700
-阿门  -阿门
</br>- Amen. - Amen.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.440
威廉
</br>William.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.900
我是你的叔叔  阿盖尔
</br>I'm your uncle. Argyle.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.500
你长得和你母亲很像
</br>You have the look of your mother.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.510
今晚我们住这里
</br>We'll stay here tonight.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.970
明天你跟我回家
</br>Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.930
我不想离开
</br>I don't want to leave.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.310
你也不希望你父亲死去  对吗
</br>You didn't want your father to die either, did you?

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.020
但这就是事实
</br>But it happened.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.570
神父不是做了祷告了吗
</br>Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.860
"愿耶和华赐福给你  保护你"
</br>"The Lord bless thee and keep thee".

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.820
是用拉丁语说的吗
</br>It was in Latin?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.490
你不懂拉丁语吗
</br>You don't speak Latin?

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.660
那我们以后得补上这一课  对吧
</br>Well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.750
愿耶和华赐福给你  保护你
</br>The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.510
愿耶和华的光芒照耀你
</br>The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.760
愿耶和华向你仰起脸
</br>The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.930

勇敢地去跟随吧
</br>Have the courage to follow it.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.930
他们在做什么
</br>What are they doing?

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.230
用他们自己的方式告别
</br>Saying goodbye in their own way.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.810
亡命的风笛演奏着亡命的旋律
</br>Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.800
我们的父亲去世时
</br>It was the same for me and your daddy

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.160
我和你父亲也看到了同样的仪式
</br>when our father was killed.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.230
首先  学会用这里
</br>First, learn to use this.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.160
之后我会教你怎么用这个
</br>Then I'll teach you to use this.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.110
很多年后
</br>Many years later,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.150
长腿爱德华  英格兰国王
</br>Edward the Longshanks, King of England,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.990
包办了他长子的婚礼
</br>supervised the wedding of his eldest son,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.660
他的长子将继承他的皇位
</br>who would succeed him to the throne.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.700
阿门
</br>Amen.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.000
至于儿子的新娘
</br>As bride for his son,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.500
长腿选择了他的对手
</br>Longshanks had chosen the daughter of his rival,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.800
法国国王的女儿
</br>the King of France.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.700
人们都说如果王妃想怀孕
</br>It was widely whispered that for the princess to conceive,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.870
长腿恐怕要亲自上阵才行
</br>Longshanks would have to do the honors himself.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.870
那也许才是他一直以来所期望的
</br>That may have been what he had in mind all along.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.920
苏格兰  是我的土地
</br>Scotland. My land.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.550
法国人会向任何强国屈服
</br>The French will grovel to anyone with strength,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.640
但如果我们不能统治全岛
</br>but how will they believe our strength

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.850
他们又怎会相信我们的强大
</br>when we cannot rule the whole of our own island?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.320
我儿子呢
</br>Where is my son?

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.990
请您原谅  陛下  他让我替他来
</br>Your pardon, milord. He asked me to come in his stead.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.830
我让他来  而他派来了你
</br>I sent for him, and he sends you.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.670
需要我离开吗  陛下
</br>Shall I leave, milord?

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.420
如果我死后他想让他的王后来统治
</br>If he wants his queen to rule when I am gone,

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.590
那你就留下吧  学习一下如何统治
</br>then, by all means, stay and learn how.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.180
请吧
</br>Please.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.680
贵族们
</br>Nobles.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.680
贵族是打开苏格兰的关键
</br>Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.440
分一些北方的土地给我们的贵族
</br>Grant our nobles lands in the north,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.400
分一些英格兰的土地给他们的贵族
</br>give their nobles estates here in England,

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.780
让他们贪婪到无法反抗我们
</br>and make them too greedy to oppose us.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.950
但  陛下  我们的贵族不愿离开家园
</br>But, sire, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.410
新的土地意味着新的赋税
</br>New lands mean new taxes,

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.490
他们已经为在法国的战争而缴税
</br>and they're already taxed for the war in France.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.910
是吗
</br>Are they?

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.750
是吗
</br>Are they?

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.940
苏格兰的问题就在于苏格兰人太多了
</br>The trouble with Scotland is that it's full of Scots.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:23.240
也许是时候恢复一个古老的习俗了
</br>Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.950
授予他们初夜权
</br>Grant them prima nocte.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.000
初夜
</br>First night.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.920
在他们土地上居住的平民女孩  若要结婚
</br>When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.530
我们的贵族将在她结婚的当夜
</br>our nobles shall have sexual

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.340
享有与她发生性关系的权利
</br>rights to her on the night of her wedding.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.970
如果不能把他们赶走  那就让他们变种
</br>If we can't get them out, we'll breed them out.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.390
这会吸引我们想要的贵族去苏格兰
</br>That should fetch just the kind of lords we want to Scotland,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.270
无论有没有赋税
</br>taxes or no taxes.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.360
-绝妙的办法  陛下  -是吗
</br>- A most excellent idea, sire. - Is it?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.180
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\b1\shad2\bord0.5\fs15\fad(334,459)\pos(187.5,184)}爱丁堡

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.580
苏格兰贵族正在爱丁堡聚集召开会议
</br>Now in Edinburgh were gathered the council of Scottish nobles.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.080
其中第十七世伯爵  罗伯特·布鲁斯
</br>Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce,

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.960
他是苏格兰王位的有力竞争者
</br>a leading contender for the crown of Scotland.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.590
我听说长腿批准了初夜权
</br>I hear that Longshanks has granted prima nocte.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.770
很明显是想吸引更多他的支持者到这儿来
</br>Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.070
我父亲认为
</br>My father believes that

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.060
我们必须骗取长腿的信任
</br>we must lull Longshanks into our confidence

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.150
既不支持也不反对他的法令
</br>by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.820
聪明的计划
</br>A wise plan.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.070
你父亲怎么样  我们都很想他
</br>And how is your father? We missed him at the council.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.030
他在法国的事务无法脱身
</br>His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.410
但他向大家问好
</br>But he sends his greetings,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.460
他说我可以代表布鲁斯家族以及苏格兰
</br>and he says that I speak for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.550
都结束了
</br>It's all over now.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.550
你的石头掉了
</br>You've dropped your rock.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.090
这是男子气概的考验
</br>Test of manhood.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.430
你赢了
</br>You win.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.730
那就当做对士兵的考验好了
</br>Call it a test of soldiery, then.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.230
英格兰人不许我们用武器训练
</br>The English won't let us train with weapons,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.730
所以我们就用石头
</br>so we train with stones.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.650
对士兵的考验不在他的臂膀  而是在头脑
</br>The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.740
不  是在这里
</br>No. It's here.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.950
你是哈米什吗
</br>Hamish?

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.050
给你  孩子
</br>Here you go, son.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.140
给他演示一下
</br>Show him how.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.550
加油  哈米什
</br>Come on, Hamish!

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.020
你绝不可能打败哈米什
</br>You'll never beat Hamish.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.140
加油啊  伙计
</br>Come on there, boy!

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.450
我的好孩子
</br>My boy!

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.660
扔得不错
</br>That's a good throw.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.410
是  是啊
</br>Aye. Aye, it was.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.660
我在想紧要关头时你还能扔得好吗
</br>I was wondering if you could do that when it matters.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.290
比如说在打仗的时候
</br>As it matters in battle.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.800
你能用那杀死一个敌人吗
</br>Could you crush a man with that throw?

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.430
我可以把你像虫子一样碾碎
</br>I could crush you like a worm.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.010
-是吗  -当然
</br>- You could? - Aye.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:40.970
那来试试吧
</br>Well, then, do it.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.810
你们想看他把我像虫子一样碾碎吗
</br>Would you like to see him crush me like a worm?

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.890
想
</br>Aye.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.650
-来吧  -你会躲的
</br>- Come do it. - You'll move.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.110
我不会的
</br>I will not.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.150
好吧
</br>Right.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.320
他会躲开的
</br>He'll move.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.410
加油  哈米什
</br>Come on, Hamish.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.450
加油啊  孩子
</br>Come on there, boy!

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.250
干得漂亮
</br>Well done!

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.270
干得漂亮  小华莱士
</br>Fine display, young Wallace.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.940
你还好吗
</br>Are you all right?

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.060
你看起来有点儿站不稳
</br>You look a wee bit shaky.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.740
我应该记住小时候扔石头的事来着
</br>I should have remembered the rocks.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.230
是啊  你应该记住的
</br>Aye, you should have.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.870
起来吧  大个子
</br>Get up, you big heap.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.370
很高兴再见到你
</br>It's good to see you again.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.200
我也是  欢迎回家
</br>Aye. Welcome home.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.830
-打到我的头了  -你该躲开的
</br>- Got my head. - Well, you should have moved.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.720
威廉  能跟我跳支舞吗
</br>William, will you dance with me?

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.770
当然了
</br>Of course I will.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.920
我来行使我的初夜权
</br>I've come to claim the right of prima nocte.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.760
作为这片土地的领主  
</br>As lord of these lands,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.230
我将以占有新娘初夜的方式
</br>I will bless this marriage by taking the bride

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.260
为这段婚姻赐福
</br>into my bed on the first night of her union.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.180
上帝啊  你不能那么做
</br>By God, you will not!

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.020
这是我的贵族特权
</br>It is my noble right.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.060
晚上好  先生
</br>Good evening, sir.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.690
小华莱士
</br>Young Wallace.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.830
非常美好的夜晚啊  是吗
</br>Grand soft evening, huh?

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.020
是啊  真美好
</br>Aye, it's that.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.780
我在想我能否跟您的女儿说句话
</br>I was wondering if I might have a word with your daughter.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.820
你要跟她说什么
</br>What do you want to have a word with her about?

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:07.910
这个嘛
</br>Well...

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.040
梅伦  你愿意
</br>Murron, would you like to

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.660
在这个美妙的夜晚跟我一起骑马吗
</br>come and ride with me on this fine evening?

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.170
这个天气吗  你疯了吧
</br>In this? You're out of your mind.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.500
这是多好的苏格兰式天气啊  夫人
</br>It's good Scottish weather, madam.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.420
雨都是直直地下  没有风
</br>The rain is falling straight down.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.000
只是稍微有点儿倾斜
</br>Slightly to the side, like.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.760
-她不能跟你去  -不行吗
</br>- She can't go with you. - No?

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.130
反正现在不行
</br>No the now, anyway.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.220
-现在不行  -现在不行吗
</br>- No the now. - No the now?

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.390
回见
</br>We'll see you later.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.510
天气正好  雨也不怎么下了
</br>The weather's just fine. It's hardly raining.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.930
你没听到我说什么吗
</br>Did you not hear what I said?

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.770
-梅伦  -梅伦  回...
</br>- Murron! - Murron! Get...

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.690
她随你
</br>It's you she takes after.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.970
过去这么久了  你怎么认出我的
</br>How did you know me after so long?

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.520
我没认出你
</br>I didn't.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.450
只是  我看见你一直盯着我看
</br>It's just... I saw you staring at me,

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.940
但我不知道你是谁
</br>and I didn't know who you were.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.150
抱歉  我想我是盯着你看了
</br>I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.900
你有在雨中跟陌生人一起骑马的习惯吗
</br>Are you in the habit of riding off in the rain with strangers?

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.320
那样才能让你离开啊
</br>It was the best way to make you leave.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.200
我要是能有勇气再邀请你一次的话
</br>If I can ever work up the courage to ask you again,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.700
我会先给你写一封信
</br>I'll send you a written warning first.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.790
那没什么帮助  我不识字
</br>That wouldn't do you much good. I can't read.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.920
-你不识字吗  -是的
</br>- Can you not? - No.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.340
这可是我们该弥补的  不是吗
</br>Well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.220
-你想教我认字吗  -如果你愿意
</br>- You're going to teach me to read, then? - If you like.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.090
-当然  -认哪种语言
</br>- Aye. - In what language?

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.260
你现在是在炫耀了
</br>You're showing off now.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.720
是啊  佩服了吧
</br>That's right. Are you impressed yet?

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.350
没  怎么  我该佩服吗
</br>No. Why? Should I be?

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.920
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}是啊

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.420
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}因为每一天我都在想着你

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.200
你倒立着再说一遍  我就服了你
</br>Do that standing on your head, and I'll be impressed.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.530
我的苏格兰短裙会飞起来  但我会试试
</br>My kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.910
天哪  你游历期间真是一点礼仪也没学到
</br>God, you certainly didn't learn any manners on your travels.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.740
法国人和罗马人的礼仪比我还糟
</br>The French and the Romans have far worse manners than I.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.060
你还去过罗马吗
</br>You've been to Rome?

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.040
是的   阿盖尔带我去朝圣
</br>Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.790
那是什么样的
</br>What was it like?

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.820
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}都没有你美丽

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.090
那是什么意思
</br>What does that mean?

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.550
很美
</br>Beautiful.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.560
但我属于这里
</br>But I belong here.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.670
梅伦  快进来
</br>Murron? Come in now.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.510
先生  我知道昨晚 
</br>Sir, I know it was strange of me

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.290
我邀请梅伦一起骑马很奇怪
</br>to invite Murron to ride last night,

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.330
但我向你保证
</br>but I assure you...

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.210
我们不是为麦克克劳恩的女儿而来
</br>MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.010
我来是叫你去参加我们的集会
</br>I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.090
-什么样的集会  -秘密的那种
</br>- What kind of meeting? - The secret kind.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.090
你们的集会不过是在浪费时间  坎贝尔
</br>Your meetings are a waste of time, Campbell.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.220
你父亲是名斗士也是一位爱国者
</br>Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.150
我知道我父亲是什么样的
</br>I know who my father was.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.060
我是回来种田的  
</br>I came back home to raise crops and,

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.230
如果可以  组建一个家庭
</br>God willing, a family.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.660
-如果能平静地生活  我会的  -走吧
</br>- If I can live in peace, I will. - Go on.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.700
你是说你不会惹麻烦吗
</br>You say you want to stay out of the troubles?

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:01.870
是的
</br>Aye.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.540
如果你能证明  就可以向我女儿求爱
</br>If you can prove it, you may court my daughter.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.080
在你证明之前  我的答案是不行
</br>Until you prove it, my answer's no.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.370
不行吗
</br>No?

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.080
不行  华莱士  不行
</br>No, Wallace. No.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.840
-我刚才还没有证明吗  -没有
</br>- Didn't I just prove it? - No!

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.760
-没有吗  -没有
</br>- No? - No!

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.930
当然了  经营农场有很多工作要做
</br>Of course, running a farm's a lot of work,

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.970
等我儿子们到了就好多了
</br>but that will all change when my sons arrive.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.060
你有孩子了
</br>So you've got children?

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.850
还没有  但我希望你能给我生几个
</br>Not yet, but I was hoping that you could help me with that.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.480
所以你是想要我嫁给你了
</br>So you want me to marry you, then?

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.940
是有点突然  不过是的
</br>It's a bit sudden, but all right.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.440
你就是这样求婚的吗
</br>Is that what you call a proposal?

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.320
我爱你  一直都是
</br>I love you. Always have.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.410
我想娶你
</br>I want to marry you.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.050
这算是答应了吗
</br>Is that a yes?

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.300
-是的  我答应了  -是吗
</br>- Aye, that's a yes. - It is?

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.340
我们最好快点  他等着呢
</br>We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.600
-等等  -你去哪
</br>- Wait. - Where are you going?

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.020
-这是什么  -你会知道的
</br>- What's that? - You'll see.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.420
神父
</br>Father.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.470
我将用我的一生来爱你
</br>I will love you my whole life,

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.440
别无她人
</br>you and no other.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.190
我也爱你
</br>And I you,

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.150
别无他人  直到永远
</br>you and no other, forever.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.450
我什么时候能再见到你
</br>When am I going to see you again?

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.950
今晚可以吗
</br>Tonight?

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.120
-不行  -为什么
</br>- I can't. - Why not?

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.290
我爸开始怀疑了
</br>My dad's growing suspicious.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.540
开始怀疑了是吗
</br>Growing suspicious, is he?

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.370
并没有什么关系  不是吗
</br>Wouldn't have anything to do with that, would it?

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.210
什么时候
</br>When? When? When?

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.750
-什么时候  -今晚
</br>- When? - Tonight.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.050
-今晚见  -今晚见
</br>- Tonight. - Tonight.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.100
打起精神来  军士
</br>Look lively, Sergeant.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.150
你去哪儿  姑娘
</br>Where are you going, lassie?

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.320
看起来挺沉
</br>That looks heavy.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.700
-我帮你拿  -不用  没关系
</br>- Let me help you with it. - No. It's fine.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.240
我不会抢走的
</br>I'm not going to steal it.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.540
你让我想起我家里的女儿了
</br>You remind me of my daughter back home.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.640
你好啊  姑娘
</br>Hello, lassie.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.360
不  不
</br>No! No!

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.620
小声点  斯迈思
</br>Keep it quiet, Smythe.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.750
臭婊子
</br>You bitch!

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.590
臭婊子
</br>You bitch!

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.260
你没事吧
</br>Are you all right?

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.270
没事吧  走
</br>All right? Come on.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:49.890
-你没事吧  -没事
</br>- Are you all right? - Aye.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.690
你没事吧
</br>Are you all right?

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.620
-能骑马吗  -可以
</br>- Can you ride? - Aye.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.120
给我回来  畜生
</br>Come back here, you bastard!

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.330
拉响警报
</br>Raise the alarm!

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.840
快帮忙
</br>Help!

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.590
在树林见  快走
</br>Meet me at the grove. Ride!

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.970
他们要跑了
</br>They're getting away!

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.810
去后面
</br>Go round back!

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.700
抓住她
</br>Get her!

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.910
快点
</br>Come on!

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.640
臭婊子
</br>You bitch!

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.200
梅伦
</br>Murron?

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.040
梅伦
</br>Murron!

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.140
你们都很清楚
</br>All of you know full well

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.640
我一直煞费苦心
</br>the great pains I've always taken

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.040
尽量在执行律法时
</br>never to be too strict,

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.060
不会过于严苛
</br>too rigid with the application of our laws.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.940
然而结果呢
</br>And as a consequence,

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.190
我们不是该学会
</br>have we not learned to live together

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.570
如何和谐共处吗
</br>in relative peace and harmony?

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:14.170
你们就是用今天这种无法无天的行为
</br>And this day's lawlessness is

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.040
来回报我的仁慈的
</br>how you repay my leniency!

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.800
你们让我别无选择
</br>Well, you leave me with little choice.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.150
攻击国王的士兵
</br>An assault on the King's soldiers

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.530
等同于攻击国王本人
</br>is the same as an assault on the King himself.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.750
现在
</br>Now,

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.500
让那个莽夫放马过来吧
</br>let this scrapper come to me.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:50.970
阁下
</br>Sir!

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.730
在那儿
</br>There.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.600
下士
</br>Corporal.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.060
弓箭手上塔楼  马上
</br>Some archers on the tower. Now!

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.620
别动  父亲
</br>Hold still, father.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.330
你个蠢货
</br>You're an idiot, boy!

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.210
父亲  你没事吧
</br>Father, you all right?

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.750
华莱士之子
</br>MacAulish.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:39.670
华莱士之子
</br>MacAulish.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.300
华莱士之子
</br>MacAulish!

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.470
华莱士之子  华莱士之子
</br>MacAulish! MacAulish!

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.640
华莱士之子  华莱士之子  
</br>MacAulish! MacAulish!

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.140
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.390
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.730
华莱士  华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.020
华莱士  华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.520
愿她的灵魂
</br>Anima ejus

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.920
及所有虔诚的灵魂
</br>et anime omnium fidelium defunctorum

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.420
在主的恩赐下
</br>per misericordiam Dei

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.020
安息
</br>requiescant in pace.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.660
还等什么  孩子
</br>What you waiting for, boy?

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.750
给你  你能做到  我按住他
</br>Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.590
给你  你能做到
</br>Here. You can do it.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.710
我按住他
</br>I'll hold him down.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.460
直接倒在伤口上  孩子
</br>Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.630
我知道这算是浪费了一瓶好酒
</br>I know it seems like a waste of good whiskey.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.130
让我放纵下吧
</br>Indulge me.

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.180
按住他  按住他
</br>Hold him. Hold him.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:42.140
按住他  现在放开他
</br>Hold him. Now let him go.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:45.230
对不起  对不起
</br>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.780
早晨把你叫醒全靠这个  孩子
</br>That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.490
有人来了
</br>There's somebody coming!

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.360
拿好武器
</br>Arm yourselves!

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.210
有人来了
</br>There's somebody coming.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.500
麦格雷戈家族  隔壁峡谷的
</br>MacGregors, from the next glen.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.760
我们听说了发生的事情
</br>We heard about what was happening.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.190
你们这帮傻瓜
</br>We don't want you Amadans

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:18.470
可不能不带我们玩
</br>thinking you can have your fun without us.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.970
-没错  -对
</br>- That's right. - Aye.

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.100
回去吧
</br>Go home.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.190
我们有些人已身涉其中
</br>Some of us are in this.

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:27.810
无能为力
</br>Can't help that now.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.440
但你们没必要这样  回去吧
</br>But you can help yourselves. Go home.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:32.540
等那些城堡里来的
</br>We'll have no homes left

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.280
英国部队来把我们的家烧掉之后
</br>when the English garrison from the castle

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.110
我们就无家可归了
</br>comes through and burns us out.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.700
-他们一定会的  -没错
</br>- And they will. - Aye.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.080
欢迎加入
</br>Welcome.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.190
侦察队回来了  大人
</br>Patrol returning, milord!

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:44.720
情况如何
</br>So what news?

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:59.280
我派了一百名士兵去拉纳克
</br>I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:01.570
他们现在应该要回来了
</br>They will be returning now!

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.120
他们是穿成这样吗
</br>Were they dressed like this?

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:07.500
事实上也就五十人
</br>Actually, it was more like 50.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.080
速度解决
</br>Make it quick.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:13.460
记得我吗
</br>You remember me?

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.300
我从没伤害过她  这是我的权利
</br>I never did her any harm. It was my right.

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.420
你的权利
</br>Your right?

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:21.300
我是来行使一名丈夫的权利的
</br>Well, I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.350
我叫威廉·华莱士
</br>I am William Wallace,

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.400
你们剩下的人会被赦免
</br>and the rest of you will be spared.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.280
回去英格兰  告诉那里的人
</br>Go back to England and tell them there

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:42.700
苏格兰儿女不再是他们的子民
</br>that Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:47.370
告诉他们苏格兰自由了
</br>Tell them Scotland is free.

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:54.710
把这烧了
</br>Burn it.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.230
射得好  大人
</br>Good job, milord.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:33.040
苏格兰反叛者攻击了我们的一处驻地
</br>Scottish rebels have routed one of my garrisons

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.380
并杀害了贵族领主
</br>and murdered the noble lord.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.920
我听说了
</br>I heard.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.710
这个华莱士只是一介强盗而已
</br>This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.920
那你会怎么对付这个强盗呢
</br>And how would you deal with this brigand?

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.430
跟对付一般的窃贼一样
</br>Like any common thief.

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:48.260
让当地治安官逮捕他并做出相应的惩罚
</br>Have the local magistrate arrest him and punish him accordingly.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:52.140
你们退下
</br>Leave us.

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:05.910
华莱士已经杀了治安官
</br>Wallace has already killed the magistrate

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.160
并控制了城镇
</br>and taken control of the town.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:10.540
起来
</br>Stand up.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.950
站起来
</br>Stand up.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.750
到早上
</br>In the morning,

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.920
我去法国促使他们承认我们的权利
</br>I depart for France to press our rights there,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.300
留你在这里镇压这起小叛乱
</br>and I leave you here to quell this little rebellion.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.090
明白了吗  懂了吗
</br>Understood? Is it?

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.600
总有一天  你将成为国王
</br>One day, you will be a King,

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.600
至少试着拿出点国王的样子来
</br>at least try to act like one.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.110
别碰我
</br>Get away from me!

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.980
传召我的军事议会
</br>Convene my military council.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:56.310
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}希望你丈夫去苏格兰

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.770
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(197.25,190)}见到华莱士

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:02.900
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(197.25,190)}然后你就会成为寡妇了

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.820
在那儿
</br>There!

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:29.950
追
</br>After them.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.390
不要做无谓的抵抗
</br>No point resisting.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.350
你们寡不敌众  已被包围
</br>You're outnumbered and trapped.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.570
其他人呢  华莱士在哪
</br>Now, where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.040
父亲
</br>Father?

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.120
进来  进来
</br>Come in. Come in.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.000
发生了叛乱
</br>A rebellion has begun.

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:29.970
谁带领的
</br>Under whom?

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:33.220
一个叫威廉·华莱士的平民
</br>A commoner named William Wallace.

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:46.570
你要支持这起叛乱
</br>You will embrace this rebellion.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.780
在我们北部领土上支持它
</br>Support it from our lands in the north.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.450
我将在我们南部地区
</br>I will gain English favor

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.000
下令不支持
</br>by condemning it and

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.540
并声讨它以赢得英国的支持
</br>ordering it opposed from our lands in the south.

01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:01.410
坐吧  待一会儿
</br>Sit down. Stay awhile.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.470
这个华莱士
</br>This Wallace,

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.470
他连骑士都不是  但他一腔热血
</br>he doesn't even have a knighthood, but he fights with passion,

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.140
能够鼓舞士气
</br>and he inspires.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.810
你也想像他那样叛变起义吗
</br>And you wish to charge off and fight as he did?

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.810
我也想
</br>So would I.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.400
也许是时候了
</br>Well, maybe it's time.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.440
现在是保命的时候
</br>It is time to survive.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.530
你是罗伯特·布鲁斯十七世
</br>You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:35.350
之前的前十六世
</br>The 16 before you passed you

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.950
能将土地与封号传给你就是因为他们没有闹事
</br>land and title because they didn't charge in.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.790
-召集贵族会议  -他们只会空谈
</br>- Call a meeting of the nobles. - They do nothing but talk.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.040
没错
</br>Rightly so.

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:46.240
他们在英格兰也有着
</br>They're as rich in English

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.000
和在苏格兰一样高贵的封号和富裕的土地
</br>titles and lands as they are in Scottish.

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:49.550
我们也一样
</br>Just as we are.

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.590
你羡慕这个威廉·华莱士
</br>You admire this man, this William Wallace.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.300
决不妥协的人总是容易让人敬佩
</br>Uncompromising men are easy to admire.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.140
他有勇气  狗也有
</br>He has courage, so does a dog.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.270
然而真正成就贵族的
</br>But it is exactly the ability to compromise

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:03.350
是妥协与让步
</br>that makes a man noble.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.600
要知道
</br>And understand this,

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:08.270
长腿爱德华是英格兰王位上
</br>Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.070
最残忍无情的国王
</br>ever to sit on the throne of England,

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:13.640
除非我们也一样残忍

聆听我们贵族的意见
</br>Give ear to our nobles.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:26.790
了解他们的想法是获得王位的关键
</br>Knowing their minds is the key to the throne.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:46.100
等等  等等  看

长腿会派整个北方军队来对付我们

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.550
重骑兵  武装战马
</br>Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

重骑兵是如何的无往不胜

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:56.480
游击战  用高地人的办法
</br>Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

上百杆
</br>Hundreds of them.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.920
很长的长矛  两人高

-要那么长吗  -对
</br>- That long? - Aye.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.250
有的人要比其他人长些
</br>Some men are longer than others.

你妈又跟你说我的事迹了
</br>Your mother been telling you stories about me again.

威廉·华莱士
</br>William Wallace,

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:31.390
我们来为你作战  誓死效忠
</br>we've come to fight and to die for you.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.270
起来吧  伙计  我可不是教皇
</br>Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.230
我叫法奥敦  我愿为你而战
</br>My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.360
我给你带了这个
</br>I brought you this.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.490
我们搜过他们的身了
</br>We checked them for arms.

-我妻子为你做的  -谢谢
</br>- My wife made it for you. - Thank you.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.790
他  不可能是威廉·华莱士
</br>Him? That can't be William Wallace.

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:56.080
我比他帅
</br>I'm prettier than this man.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.710
好了  圣父  我问问他
</br>All right, Father. I'll ask him.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.390
若我为你出生入死
</br>If I risk my neck for you,

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.970
我有机会杀英国人吗
</br>will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.900
你的圣父是先人的灵魂  
</br>Is your Father a ghost,

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.600
还是你能与上帝交流
</br>or do you converse with the Almighty?

01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.190
为了找到旗鼓相当的对手
</br>In order to find his equal,

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.860
爱尔兰人被迫与上帝交谈
</br>an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.980
什么  圣父
</br>Yes, Father?

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:20.150
上帝说不要转移话题
</br>The Almighty says don't change the subject,

01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:21.820
回答那该死的问题
</br>just answer the fucking question.

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:22.860
说话注意些
</br>Mind your tongue.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.450
爱尔兰疯子
</br>Insane Irish.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.290
至少足够聪明躲过检查带匕首进来  老头
</br>Smart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.210
这是我朋友  爱尔兰人
</br>That's my friend, Irishman,

01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:37.330
而我的答案是肯定的
</br>and the answer to your question is yes.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.340
你为我而战  就能杀到英国人
</br>You fight for me, you get to kill the English.

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.010
好极了
</br>Excellent!

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:44.220
我叫斯蒂芬
</br>Stephen is my name.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.830
在我的岛上我可是头号通缉犯
</br>I'm the most wanted man on my island,

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:49.510
不过当然我没在岛上
</br>except I'm not on my island, of course.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.010
真是遗憾
</br>More's the pity.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.350
你的岛  你是说爱尔兰吗
</br>Your island? You mean Ireland?

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.020
没错  那是我的
</br>Yeah. It's mine.

01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:01.270
你真是个疯子
</br>You're a madman.

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:11.030
看来我来对地方了
</br>I've come to the right place, then.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.660
确定不是上帝派我来保护你的吗
</br>Sure didn't the Almighty send me to watch your back?

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.290
反正我也不喜欢他
</br>I didn't like him anyway.

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.670
他脑袋不对劲
</br>He wasn't right in the head.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.220
威廉
</br>William!

01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.140
来了几个传信员
</br>It's several runners!

01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:13.780
英格兰派军队往斯特灵来了
</br>The English are advancing an army toward Stirling.

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:14.990
贵族们达成一致了吗
</br>Do the nobles rally?

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.490
罗伯特·布鲁斯还有绝大多数人都不会参战
</br>Robert the Bruce and most of the others will not commit to battle,

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.910
但事情已经传开了
</br>but word has spread,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.830
高地人自己来了
</br>and the Highlanders are coming down on their own.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.250
对  成百上千
</br>Aye, in droves of hundreds and thousands.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.000
准备好一战了吗
</br>Are you ready for a war?

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.820

我听不清  但看上去不妙
</br>I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:11.510
贵族们会谈判的
</br>The nobles will negotiate.

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:14.010
他们会达成协议  之后我们就打道回府
</br>They'll do a deal, then we go home.

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:17.050
如果不然  我们就进攻
</br>If not, we charge.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:20.010
三百匹重装战马  我们没胜算的
</br>Three hundred heavy horse, we've no chance.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.030
太多了
</br>So many.

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.750
我来战斗不是为了让他们拥有更多土地
</br>I didn't come here to fight so they could own more lands.

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:31.250
以后我还得给他们干活
</br>Then I'll have to work for them.

</br>Stop, men! Do not flee!

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.450
等我们谈判好了再走
</br>Wait until we've negotiated!

是威廉·华莱士
</br>William Wallace.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.300
不可能  他不够高
</br>Can't be. Not tall enough.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.780
上帝说这一定是场上流的战争
</br>The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight.

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:25.660

你为什么不行礼
</br>Where is thy salute?

对你亲临战场  我向你致谢

这是我们的军队

</br>To join it, you give homage.

我效忠于苏格兰
</br>I give homage to Scotland,

为什么它要散了
</br>why does it go?

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:45.300
我们来不是为了他们而战
</br>We didn't come here to fight for them!

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.180
回家  英格兰军队的人太多了
</br>Home! The English are too many.

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:01.990
苏格兰的孩子们

他杀的人数以百计
</br>He kills men by the hundreds,

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.290
他要是在这  会把英军杀得屁滚尿流
</br>and if he were here, he'd consume the English

01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:16.220
就用双眼射出的火球
</br>with fireballs from his eyes

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:19.000
和屁股里放出的闪电
</br>and bolts of lightning from his arse.

在此抵抗暴政
</br>here in defiance of tyranny.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.560
你们身为自由人来此战斗
</br>You've come to fight as free men.

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.400
而此时此刻你们是自由的
</br>And free men you are.

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:48.030
你们要用那自由去做什么
</br>What will you do with that freedom?

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.790
你们会战斗吗
</br>Will you fight?

01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:54.830
不会  不会  不会
</br>No! No! No!

</br>Fight? Against that? No!

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.790
我们会逃跑  会活下去
</br>We will run, and we will live.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.090
没错
</br>Aye.

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:04.220
战斗  你也许会死
</br>Fight, and you may die.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.260
逃跑  你会活下去
</br>Run, and you'll live.

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.010
至少能活一阵
</br>At least a while.

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:15.640
然后许多年后躺在床上奄奄一息
</br>And dying in your beds many years from now,

01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:22.230
那时你会不会想用你苟且偷生来的岁月去换取
</br>would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.980
一个机会  就这么一个机会
</br>for one chance, just one chance,

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:28.160
回到这里  告诉我们的敌人
</br>to come back here and tell our enemies

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.700
他们或许可以夺走我们的生命
</br>that they may take our lives,

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:34.620
但他们永远无法夺走我们的自由
</br>but they'll never take our freedom!

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.420
苏格兰万岁
</br>Alba gu brath!

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.900
在我看来  他们相当乐观
</br>They seem quite optimistic to me.

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.190
或许他们真的愿意战斗
</br>Maybe they do want to fight.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.860
交战也许是不可避免的  大人
</br>Confrontation might be a foregone conclusion, milord,

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:09.990
但尽管如此  
</br>but, nonetheless,

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:12.070
我认为我们应先传达国王的条件
</br>I think we should deliver the king's terms.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:15.410
国王的条件  他绝对不会兑现的
</br>The king's terms? He'll never live up to them.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.000
大人  我认为...
</br>Milord, I think...

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.670
好吧  把条件说给他们听
</br>All right. Offer them the terms.

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:24.960
他们过来了  我们要过去与他们会面吗
</br>They're coming out. Shall we go and meet them?

01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:27.380
-我来跟他们谈  同意吗  -同意
</br>- Let me do the talking. Agreed? - Agreed.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.770
讲得不错
</br>Fine speech.

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:37.600
我们现在怎么做
</br>Now what do we do?

01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:41.190
做你自己就好
</br>Just be yourselves.

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:43.400
你要去哪里
</br>Where are you going?

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.520
我去挑衅下
</br>I'm going to pick a fight.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.530
看来我们没白全副武装
</br>Well, we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.120
莫尔奈  洛克林  克雷格.
</br>Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:07.300
以下是国王的条件
</br>Here are the king's terms.

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.550
将你们的军队带离战场
</br>Lead this army off the field,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.810
他会赏给你们每个人约克郡的土地
</br>and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire,

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.100
包括世袭封号
</br>including hereditary title,

01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:23.690
据此你们要付...
</br>from which you will pay...

01:20:23.770 --> 01:20:25.860
据此你们要交付年税...
</br>From which you will pay him an annual duty...

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.400
我有个提议给你
</br>I have an offer for you.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.990
切尔汉姆  这位是威廉·华莱士
</br>Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.030
据此你们向国王要交付年税...
</br>From which you will pay the king an annual duty...

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.490
我说了我有个提议给你
</br>I said I have an offer for you.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.200
你是在藐视休战的旗帜么
</br>You disrespect a banner of truce?

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:39.370
他的国王的旗帜  当然了
</br>From his king? Absolutely.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.620
以下是苏格兰的条件
</br>Here are Scotland's terms.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.590
降下你们的旗帜  直接返回英格兰
</br>Lower your flags and march straight back to England,

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:49.300
在路过的每户人家前停下
</br>stopping at every home you pass by to beg forgiveness

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.260
为百年来的偷窃  强奸和谋杀行为祈求宽恕
</br>for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:55.680
照做  你的人就能活下去
</br>Do that and your men shall live.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.930
否则  今天就是你们的死期
</br>Do it not and every one of you will die today.

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.980
你们毫无胜算
</br>You are outmatched.

01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:09.860
你们没有重骑兵
</br>You have no heavy cavalry.

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.320
两个世纪以来  没有军队曾打败...
</br>ln two centuries, no army has won...

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.030
我还没说完
</br>I'm not finished!

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.330
在我们放你们走之前
</br>Before we let you leave,

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:21.390
你的指挥官必须穿过这片战场
</br>your commander must cross that field,

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:23.710
在我们的军队面前现身
</br>present himself before this army,

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:25.830
将他的头置于两腿中间
</br>put his head between his legs,

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.790
亲他自己的屁股
</br>and kiss his own arse.

01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:40.930
要我说他没以前那么亲切了
</br>I'd say that was rather less cordial than he was used to.

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:43.310
你们准备好  照我说的做
</br>You be ready and do exactly as I say.

01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:44.440
看我信号
</br>On my signal,

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.560
骑马从我们背后绕过去  攻击他们的侧翼
</br>ride round behind our position and flank them.

01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:49.150
我们不应该分散兵力
</br>We must not divide our forces.

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:52.110
照做  并且让英格兰军队看见你这么做了
</br>Do it and let the English see you do it.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.530
他们会认为我们逃跑了
</br>They'll think we run away.

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:58.410
灭掉他们的弓手  我在中间与你们会合
</br>Take out their archers. I'll meet you in the middle.

01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:00.030
好的  来吧
</br>Right. Come on.

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.350
傲慢无礼的杂种
</br>Insolent bastard.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.270
我要把这个华莱士的心脏挖出来放盘子上
</br>I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.730
弓手准备
</br>Archers.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.480
弓手  弓手  弓手
</br>Archers! Archers! Archers!

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:43.160
-弓手  前进  -弓手  前进
</br>- Archers, forward! - Archers, forward!

01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:40.590
你们这群混蛋
</br>You bastards!

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.590
放箭
</br>Loose!

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.400
主告诉我他能助我逃离这场混乱
</br>The Lord tells me he can get me out of this mess,

01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:42.030
但他很确信你完蛋了
</br>but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.840
-准备  -放箭
</br>- Ready! - Loose!

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.240
骑马走
</br>Ride!

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.410
看吧  所有骑着马的苏格兰人都逃走了
</br>See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.540
我们的重骑兵会像碾过草地一样碾死他们
</br>Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.130
派出骑兵
</br>Send the horse.

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:37.880
全力进攻
</br>Full attack.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.990
稳住
</br>Steady!

01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:56.790
别动
</br>Hold!

01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:00.330
别动
</br>Hold!

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.050
别动
</br>Hold!

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.100
别动
</br>Hold!

01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:27.110
现在
</br>Now!

01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:13.950
派步兵上
</br>Send the infantry.

01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:16.080
-大人...  -你去领兵
</br>- Milord... - You lead them!

01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:36.880
撤退
</br>Retreat!

01:31:11.630 --> 01:31:14.420
混蛋
</br>Bastard!

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.590
好了
</br>All right.

01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:31.670
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.850
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:55.190
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:59.110
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:14.210
我封你为威廉·华莱士爵士
</br>I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:21.010
威廉爵士  以天主之名
</br>Sir William, in the name of God,

01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:24.760
我们宣布指派你为苏格兰的守护者和护国公
</br>we declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.970
任命你的队长们为你的副官
</br>and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.220
起身接受祝贺吧
</br>Stand and be recognized.

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:43.990
有人知道他的政治立场吗
</br>Does anyone know his politics?

01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:47.700
不知道  但他在平民心中的分量可颠覆一切
</br>No, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:51.370
巴里奥家族肯定会拍他马屁  我们也得照做
</br>The Balliols will kiss his arse, and so we must.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.550
威廉爵士
</br>Sir William.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.590
威廉爵士
</br>Sir William,

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.680
既然您和您的队长们都来自一个
</br>in as much as you and your captains hail from a region

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.640
长久以来众所周知支持巴里奥家族的地区
</br>long known to support the Balliol clan,

01:34:13.730 --> 01:34:16.520
我们能否请您继续支持
</br>may we invite you to continue your support

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.360
并捍卫我们的合法权利
</br>and uphold our rightful claim?

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.320
该死的巴里奥家族
</br>Damn the Balliol clan!

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.900
他们都是长腿的走狗
</br>They're all Longshanks' men!

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:28.200
先生们  先生们
</br>Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.160
-是时候决定谁是国王了  -等等
</br>- Now is the time to declare a king. - Wait!

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:34.200
你是说你准备承认我们的正统继承权了
</br>And you're prepared to recognize our legitimate succession, I take it.

01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:36.160
你们才是不肯支持真正国王的人
</br>You're the ones who won't support the rightful king.

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.000
你当初写的时候那些就是谎言
</br>Those were lies when you first wrote them.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.750
-不  -这是事实
</br>- No. - That's the truth.

01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.000
我要求认可这些文件
</br>I demand recognition of these documents!

01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:45.090
这些文件在你当初写的时候就是谎言
</br>These documents were lies when you wrote them!

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.390
先生们  请静一静  先生们
</br>Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!

01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:51.100
静一静  先生们
</br>Please, gentlemen!

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:53.970
等等  威廉爵士  你要去哪里
</br>Wait! Sir William, where are you going?

01:34:56.270 --> 01:35:00.730
我们击败了英格兰军  但他们会卷土重来
</br>We have beaten the English, but they'll come back

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.530
因为你们不愿团结一致
</br>because you won't stand together.

01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:04.820
你要做什么
</br>What will you do?

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:06.780
我要入侵英格兰
</br>I will invade England

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:09.700
在英格兰人自己的土地上打败他们
</br>and defeat the English on their own ground.

01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:14.120
入侵  那不可能
</br>lnvade? That's impossible.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.620
为什么
</br>Why?

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.710
为什么不可能
</br>Why is that impossible?

01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:19.390
你们忙着
</br>You're so concerned with

01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:22.590
争夺长腿桌上的残羹冷炙
</br>squabbling for the scraps from Longshanks' table

01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:26.840
却忽视了上天赐予的更好的权利
</br>that you've missed your God-given right to something better.

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.380
我们是不同的
</br>There's a difference between us.

01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:31.180
你们认为这个国家的人民之所以存在
</br>You think the people of this country exist

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.890
是为了使你们拥有如今的地位
</br>to provide you with position.

01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:35.340
我认为你们的地位之所以存在
</br>I think your position exists

01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.060
是为了让这些人民获得自由
</br>to provide those people with freedom,

01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:42.110
而我会确保他们拥有这自由
</br>and I go to make sure that they have it.

01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:56.490
等等
</br>Wait!

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.460
我敬佩你刚才说的话
</br>I respect what you said,

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:05.000
但你要记住这些人拥有土地和城堡
</br>but remember that these men have lands and castles.

01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:06.840
风险太大了
</br>lt's much to risk.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.800
那在战场上流血的平民
</br>And the common man that bleeds on the battlefield,

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.630
他冒的风险就小了
</br>does he risk less?

01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:16.810
不
</br>No.

01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:20.440
但从上到下  这个国家完全没有主权意识
</br>But from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.690
它的贵族们为英格兰人效忠
</br>Its nobles share allegiance with England.

01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:25.480
家族之间彼此争斗
</br>Its clans war with each other.

01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:27.030
-没错  -没错
</br>- Aye. - Aye.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.950
如果你腹背受敌
</br>lf you make enemies on both sides of the border,

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:32.450
你只有死路一条
</br>you'll end up dead.

01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:35.160
人终有一死  只看是如何死  又为何而死
</br>We all end up dead. It's just a question of how and why.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.100
我不是懦夫
</br>I'm not a coward.

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.290
我与你所求相同  但我们需要贵族
</br>I want what you want, but we need the nobles.

01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:41.080
-我们需要他们  -没错
</br>- We need them? - Aye.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.370
贵族
</br>Nobles.

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:46.290
现在  告诉我  成为贵族意味着什么
</br>Now, tell me, what does that mean, to be noble?

01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:49.050
你的封号让你有资格成为我们国家的国王
</br>Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country,

01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:51.630
但人们追随的不是封号
</br>but men don't follow titles.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.430
他们追随的是勇气
</br>They follow courage.

01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:55.390
你的名字家喻户晓
</br>Now, our people know you.

01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:57.100
无论是贵族还是平民  都尊敬你
</br>Noble and common, they respect you,

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:00.810
如果你愿意带领他们获得自由
</br>and if you would just lead them to freedom,

01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:04.900
他们会追随你
</br>they'd follow you.

01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:08.610
我也会
</br>And so would l.

01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:32.010
该死
</br>Damn it!

01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:33.940
我那爱玩鸡奸的王子堂弟告诉我
</br>My sodomite cousin the prince tells me

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.010
他没有军队借我了
</br>he has no troops to lend,

01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:38.640
英格兰北部的城镇没有一个不在求援的
</br>and every town in northern England is begging for help.

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.720
-他进军了  -朝哪个城镇
</br>- He advances! - To which town?

01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:43.600
朝这里  大人
</br>To here, milord.

01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:45.850
将食物和补给收入城内
</br>Bring the food and provisions inside.

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:48.440
加倍城墙上的守卫  封锁大门  快去
</br>Double the wall guards, seal the gate. Now!

01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:52.150
把补给收入城内
</br>Bring in the provisions!

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.100
大人  如果您现在离开  我们能带您出去
</br>Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.690
我不想告诉我的叔叔
</br>I'm not about to tell my uncle

01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:29.110
我把他英格兰北部最大的城丢了
</br>I've lost him the greatest city in northern England.

01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.440
我们上
</br>Come on!

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.390
为国王让路
</br>Make way for the king!

01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:58.400
这不是你的错
</br>lt's not your fault.

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.530
勇敢地面对他
</br>Stand up to him!

01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:03.280
我不仅会勇敢地面对他
</br>I will stand up to him and more.

01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:42.990
北部有什么消息
</br>What news of the north?

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:46.240
没有新消息  陛下
</br>Nothing new, Your Majesty.

01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:48.660
我们已派遣骑士加快传信速度
</br>We've sent riders to speed any word.

01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:50.540
我在法国时听到了消息
</br>I heard the word in France,

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.000
我在那竭力为你扩张未来帝国的版图
</br>where I was fighting to expand your future kingdom.

01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:55.880
吾儿  消息说
</br>The word, my son,

01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.130
我们北部军队已全军覆没
</br>is that our entire northern army is annihilated,

01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:03.930
而你毫无作为
</br>and you have done nothing.

01:41:05.010 --> 01:41:06.760
我已下令征兵  陛下
</br>I have ordered conscriptions, sir.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.640
他们已集合完毕  整装待发
</br>They're assembled and ready to depart.

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:14.400
打扰一下  陛下  约克郡有紧急消息
</br>Excuse me, sire, but there's a very urgent message from York.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.980
进来
</br>Come.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.410
-退下吧  -谢谢您  陛下
</br>- Leave us. - Thank you, sire.

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:32.330
-华莱士洗劫了约克郡  -什么
</br>- Wallace has sacked York. - What?

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620
华莱士洗劫了约克郡
</br>Wallace has sacked York!

01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:52.850
陛下  您的亲侄子
</br>Sire, thy own nephew.

01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:56.730
什么样的禽兽才会下此狠手
</br>What beast could do such a thing?

01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.360
如果他能攻下约克郡
</br>lf he can sack York,

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:05.110
他也可以入侵英格兰腹地
</br>he can invade lower England.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.030
我们会阻止他的
</br>We would stop him!

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.090
这个和我说话
</br>Who is this person who

01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:14.120
自以为我需要他建议的人是谁
</br>speaks to me as though I needed his advice?

01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:18.630
我已任命菲利普为我的高级参谋
</br>I have declared Philip my high counselor.

01:42:18.710 --> 01:42:20.210
他能胜任
</br>Is he qualified?

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.590
我精通战争艺术和军事战略  陛下
</br>I am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire.

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:26.720
是吗
</br>Are you?

01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:31.600
那告诉我  就目前形势
</br>Then tell me, what advice would you offer

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.930
你会给出什么建议
</br>on the present situation?

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.930
我应该提出休战
</br>I shall offer a truce

01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:11.430
收买他
</br>and buy him off.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:16.600
但谁去和他谈呢  不能是我
</br>But who will go to him? Not I.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:20.750
如果我倒在那凶手的剑下
</br>If I fell under the sword of that murderer,

01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.230
篮子里可能就是我的脑袋了
</br>it might be my head in a basket.

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.780
我温和的儿子也不行
</br>And not my gentle son.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.410
仅仅是看他一眼
</br>The mere sight of him

01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:33.370
都会鼓励我们的敌人拿下整个国家
</br>would only encourage an enemy to take over the whole country.

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:38.710
那我应该派谁去呢
</br>So whom do I send?

01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:44.460
派谁去呢
</br>Whom do I send?

01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:09.210
我在做梦
</br>I'm dreaming.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.340
对  你在做梦
</br>Yes, you are.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.890
你得醒过来
</br>And you must wake.

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.520
我不想醒过来
</br>I don't want to wake.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.690
我想在这陪着你
</br>I want to stay here with you.

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.700
我也想陪着你
</br>And I with you,

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:35.320
但你现在必须醒过来
</br>but you must wake now.

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.580
醒醒  威廉
</br>Wake up, William.

01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:42.290
醒醒
</br>Wake up.

01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:46.540
威廉  醒醒  醒醒
</br>William, wake up, wake up.

01:45:47.170 --> 01:45:48.340
威廉
</br>William!

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:52.090
来了位皇家使者  打着休战旗
</br>A royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce

01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:54.930
还有长腿的军旗
</br>and the standards of Longshanks himself!

01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:40.930
我是威尔士王妃
</br>I am the Princess of Wales.

01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:44.020
我奉国王之命而来
</br>I come as the king's servant and with his authority.

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:46.520
来干什么
</br>To do what?

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.860
来谈谈国王的提议
</br>To discuss the king's proposals.

01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.980
你愿意和女流之辈谈吗
</br>Will you speak with a woman?

01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:17.380
我知道你刚刚被授予骑士爵位
</br>I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.

01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:19.680
没人给过我什么东西
</br>I have been given nothing.

01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:22.260
上帝决定了人们的身份
</br>God makes men what they are.

01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:25.600
上帝让你去洗劫安宁的城市吗
</br>Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities,

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.480
上帝让你处决国王的外甥  我丈夫的表弟
</br>the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:34.480
约克郡是入侵我国的跳板
</br>York was the staging point for every invasion of my country,

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.280
你那皇家表弟在城墙上绞死过
</br>and that royal cousin hanged innocent Scots,

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:40.360
无辜的苏格兰人  甚至连女人和孩子都不放过
</br>even women and children, from the city walls.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.620
上次长腿攻下苏格兰城市时手段更残忍
</br>Longshanks did far worse the last time he took a Scottish city.

01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:51.020
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(193.5,190)}他就是个残暴的野蛮人

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.150
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}而且他在撒谎

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.360
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}我从不撒谎

01:47:58.450 --> 01:48:00.110
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(191.25,190)}但我确实是个野蛮人

01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:05.450
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs12\shad2\bord0\b1\pos(188.25,190)}还是你们想说法语

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.770
你当面问问你的国王
</br>You ask your king to his face.

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.100
问问他
</br>Ask him.

01:48:13.730 --> 01:48:17.030
看他能否用眼神说服你相信真相
</br>You see if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.910
汉密尔顿  退下吧
</br>Hamilton, leave us.

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.540
-夫人  -快退下吧
</br>- Milady... - Leave us. Now.

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.300
我们就直说吧
</br>Let us talk plainly.

01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:47.720
你入侵英格兰
</br>You invade England,

01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:49.340
但你不可能征服英格兰全境
</br>but you cannot complete the conquest

01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:51.890
这里距离你的大本营太远  补给困难
</br>so far from your shelter and supply.

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.440
国王渴望和平
</br>The king desires peace.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.980
长腿渴望和平
</br>Longshanks desires peace?

01:48:58.070 --> 01:49:00.530
他对我说的  我发誓
</br>He declares it to me. I swear it.

01:49:00.610 --> 01:49:02.910
他提议  你停止进攻
</br>He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:06.030
作为回报  他会赐予你封号  领地
</br>In return, he grants you title, estates,

01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:10.200
还有一箱金子  由我亲自交给你
</br>and this chest of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.

01:49:10.290 --> 01:49:12.250
领地和封号
</br>A lordship and titles.

01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:13.330
还有金子
</br>Gold.

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.080
然后我就得变成叛徒
</br>That I should become Judas?

01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:16.710
和平就是这样产生的
</br>Peace is made in such ways.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.090
奴隶才是这样产生的
</br>Slaves are made in such ways!

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.550
上次长腿谈及和平时  我还是个孩子
</br>The last time Longshanks spoke of peace, I was a boy,

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.010
许多不愿成为奴隶的苏格兰贵族
</br>and many Scottish nobles, who would not be slaves,

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.180
被他所谓的休战引诱
</br>were lured by him, under a flag of truce,

01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:33.480
在谷仓里被他绞死
</br>to a barn where he had them hanged.

01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:36.810
那时我还很小
</br>I was very young,

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.360
但我记得长腿所谓的和平
</br>but I remember Longshanks' notion of peace.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.910
我理解你所经历的痛苦
</br>I understand you have suffered.

01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:50.370
我知道你女人的事
</br>I know about your woman.

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.880
她是我妻子
</br>She was my wife.

01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:07.470
我们秘密结婚
</br>We married in secret

01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:10.890
因为我不愿让英格兰领主碰她
</br>because I would not share her with an English lord.

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:14.890
他们为了抓我  把她杀了
</br>They killed her to get to me.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.480
我从没说起过这事
</br>I have never spoken of it.

01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:27.030
我也不知道为什么现在告诉你这些  只是
</br>I don't know why I tell you now, expect

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:32.370
我在你身上看见了她的坚强
</br>I see her strength in you.

01:50:38.210 --> 01:50:40.460
有一天  你会成为女王
</br>One day, you'll be a queen,

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.010
你一定要睁大眼睛
</br>and you must open your eyes.

01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:57.310
你告诉国王  威廉·华莱士不接受统治
</br>You tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled,

01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:00.560
只要我还活着  苏格兰人也不会
</br>and nor will any Scot while I live.

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:38.600
我的儿媳妇没被异教徒杀死  安全归来了
</br>My son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen.

01:51:38.690 --> 01:51:40.100
他接受我们的收买了吗
</br>So he accepted our bribe?

01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:41.770
没有  他不接受
</br>No, he did not.

01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:45.480
那他为什么按兵不动
</br>Then why does he stay?

01:51:45.570 --> 01:51:48.740
我的侦察兵说  他没进军
</br>My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.910
他在约克郡等你
</br>He waits for you at York.

01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:53.740
他说他不会再攻击城镇
</br>He says he will attack no more towns or cities

01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:56.540
只要你够男人敢去跟他会面
</br>if you are man enough to come and face him.

01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:57.910
是吗
</br>Did he?

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.840
威尔士弓箭手可以偷偷
</br>The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:07.010
绕过他的侧翼抵达这里
</br>arriving so far around his flank.

01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:11.720
我们从法国调来的主力
</br>The main force of our armies from France will land here

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.800
可以从爱丁堡北部登陆
</br>to the north of Edinburgh.

01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:19.690
爱尔兰的新军从西南方进军至此
</br>Conscripts from Ireland will approach from the southwest to here.

01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:22.630
威尔士弓箭手  法国军队
</br>Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?

01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:23.480
爱尔兰新军
</br>Irish conscripts?

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:26.900
就算你今天调遣  也需要几周集结军队
</br>Even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:30.610
派你妻子去之前  我就发出了调遣命令
</br>I dispatched them before I sent your wife.

01:52:35.370 --> 01:52:37.790
我们的小策略成功了
</br>So our little ruse succeeded.

01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:39.910
谢谢
</br>Thank you.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.790
这自负的家伙在约克郡等我的时候
</br>And while this upstart awaits my arrival in York,

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.670
我的部队已经到达他身后的爱丁堡了 
</br>my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind him.

01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:55.430
你跟这个华莱士私下谈过
</br>You spoke with this Wallace in private.

01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.850
告诉我
</br>Tell me,

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:01.560
他是个什么样的人
</br>what kind of man is he?

01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.860
愚蠢的野蛮人
</br>A mindless barbarian.

01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:08.280
不像国王您  陛下
</br>Not a king like you, milord.

01:53:10.530 --> 01:53:12.950
你可以回房绣花了
</br>You may return to your embroidery.

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.530
当然  陛下
</br>Humbly, milord.

01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:18.290
你把金子带回来了吧
</br>You brought back the money, of course.

01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:22.750
没有
</br>No.

01:53:23.650 --> 01:53:26.460
我把金子分给了孩子们  以平息战争之痛
</br>I gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.630
你派个女人去  就会这样
</br>That's what happens when you send a woman.

01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:35.180
原谅我  陛下
</br>Forgive me, sire.

01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:39.310
我觉得这种慷慨可以向那些您打算统治的人
</br>I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness

01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:41.730
证实您的伟大
</br>to those you mean to rule.

01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:47.770
我的伟大会在华莱士回到苏格兰
</br>My greatness will be better demonstrated

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:53.240
却发现他的国家成为灰烬时得到更好的证明
</br>when Wallace returns to Scotland and finds his country in ashes.

01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.450
威廉
</br>William!

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:01.540
有人骑着马过来了
</br>There's riders approaching!

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:11.800
王妃的贴身侍女
</br>Personal escort of the princess.

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.380
对
</br>Aye.

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.430
你肯定给她留下了深刻印象
</br>Must have made an impression.

01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.350
对
</br>Aye.

01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:21.430
没觉得你在帐篷里待了那么长时间啊
</br>I didn't think you were in the tent that long.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:26.600
小姐
</br>Mademoiselle.

01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.000
女主人给你的信
</br>Un message de ma maîtresse.

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:31.600
谢谢
</br>Merci.

01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.600
是真的  英国船正从南方逼近
</br>It's true! English ships are moving up from the south!

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.420
还不清楚威尔士军队的情况
</br>I don't know about the Welsh yet,

01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.760
但爱尔兰人已经登陆了
</br>but the Irish have landed!

01:55:02.850 --> 01:55:05.890
要不是亲眼看到我真是不敢相信
</br>I had to see it with me own eyes before I could believe it.

01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:08.310
爱尔兰人为什么和英国人并肩作战
</br>What the hell are the Irish doing fighting with the English?

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.060
我不担心他们
</br>I wouldn't worry about them.

01:55:10.150 --> 01:55:14.280
我之前不是说过吗  那是我的岛
</br>Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:17.950
哈米什  骑马去爱丁堡  召集贵族
</br>Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh and assemble the council.

01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:19.740
-命令他们开会  -好
</br>- Order it. - Aye.

01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:27.290
-你的岛  -我的岛  没错
</br>- Your island? - My island! Yup!

01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:30.040
你想谈判
</br>You want to negotiate?

01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:31.460
不  拜托  先生们
</br>No, please, gentlemen!

01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.920
领主们  克雷格说得对
</br>Lords, Craig is right!

01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:37.170
当下  我们唯一的选择就是谈判
</br>This time, our only option is to negotiate.

01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:40.760
除非你们想看着爱丁堡被夷为平地
</br>Now, unless you want to see Edinburgh razed to the ground...

01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:50.560
我的军队已经马不停蹄地行军不知道多少天了
</br>My army has marched for more days than I can remember

01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:52.440
我们还有准备要做
</br>and we still have preparations to make,

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:54.690
所以我就直说了
</br>so I'll make this plain.

01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.360
我们需要你们能召集的所有士兵
</br>We require every soldier you can summon.

01:55:58.450 --> 01:56:01.370
你们的贴身侍卫  甚至你们自己
</br>Your personal escorts, even yourselves,

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:03.620
现在就要
</br>and we need them now.

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.890
现在大敌当前
</br>With such a force arrayed against us,

01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:08.540
是时候讨论其他方案了
</br>it's time to discuss other options.

01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:10.210
其他方案
</br>Other options?

01:56:11.710 --> 01:56:15.630
你们难道不希望至少带着你们的人到战场上去
</br>Don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the field

01:56:15.710 --> 01:56:18.090
跟长腿谈个更好的条件
</br>and barter a better deal with Longshanks

01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:19.970
然后再夹起尾巴逃跑吗
</br>before you tuck tail and run?

01:56:20.050 --> 01:56:21.930
-威廉爵士  -我们打不赢他们
</br>- Sir William... - We can't defeat this army!

01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:23.200
-我们能  -威廉爵士
</br>- We can! - Sir William!

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:23.990
我们也会打赢
</br>And we will!

01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:30.100
我们在斯特灵取得了胜利  你们不置可否
</br>We won at Stirling, and still you quibble!

01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:34.820
我们在约克郡取得了胜利  你们还不愿支持我们
</br>We won at York, and you would not support us.

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.060
如果你们现在不和我们并肩作战  
</br>If you'll not stand up with us now,

01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:39.280
那要我说你们就是懦夫
</br>then I say you're cowards.

01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:48.750
你们要算是苏格兰人  我真是羞于与你们为伍
</br>And if you are Scotsmen, I'm ashamed to call myself one.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.290
威廉爵士  请单独和我聊聊
</br>Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:55.960
我请求你
</br>I beg you.

01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:02.010
你取得了任何人都不敢想象的胜利
</br>Now, you've achieved more than anyone ever dreamed,

01:57:02.090 --> 01:57:05.850
但这种形式下主战更像愤怒而非勇气
</br>but fighting these odds, it looks like rage, not courage.

01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:07.890
远不止是愤怒
</br>It's well beyond rage.

01:57:09.850 --> 01:57:11.440
帮帮我
</br>Help me.

01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:16.230
看在上帝的份上  帮帮你自己
</br>In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.280
现在我们的机会来了  现在
</br>Now is our chance. Now.

01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:20.440
如果我们联合  我们就能赢
</br>If we join, we can win.

01:57:20.530 --> 01:57:22.140
我们赢了  就会取得
</br>If we win, well, then we'll

01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:24.660
前所未有的成就
</br>have what none of us have ever had before.

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:27.120
我们自己的国家
</br>A country of our own.

01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:31.500
你是合法的领袖
</br>You're the rightful leader,

01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:33.620
我看见了你身上的力量
</br>and there is strength in you. I see it.

01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:40.460
团结我们
</br>Unite us.

01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:45.140
团结我们
</br>Unite us!

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:47.100
团结各族
</br>Unite the clans.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.850
好吧
</br>All right.

01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:56.440
好
</br>Right.

01:58:01.610 --> 01:58:03.530
不能这样
</br>This cannot be the way.

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.660
你自己说的  贵族们不会支持华莱士
</br>You said yourself, the nobles will not support Wallace.

01:58:10.330 --> 01:58:14.500
加入被屠杀的一方  对我们有什么用
</br>So how does it help us to join the side that is slaughtered?

01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:17.330
我向他保证过了
</br>I gave him my word.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:27.510
我知道这很难
</br>I know it is hard.

01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:30.010
当领袖是很难
</br>Being a leader is.

01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:32.640
孩子...
</br>Now, Son...

01:58:33.810 --> 01:58:36.480
孩子  看着我
</br>son, look at me.

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:45.860
我不能成为国王
</br>I cannot be king.

01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:49.830
只有你可以统治苏格兰
</br>You and you alone can rule Scotland.

01:58:50.370 --> 01:58:52.990
我告诉你的  你必须照做
</br>What I tell you, you must do.

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.750
不是为我  也不是为你自己
</br>Not for me, not for yourself,

01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:57.830
而是为了你的国家
</br>for your country.

01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:02.820
{\an8\fn方正黑体_GBK\b1\shad2\bord0.5\fs15\fad(334,459)\pos(190.5,183)}福尔柯克

01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:15.310
伙计  借过
</br>Lads, make way.

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:16.560
让我们过去
</br>Coming through you.

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:25.240
借过  伙计
</br>Make way, lads.

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:26.820
借过...
</br>Make...

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:33.120
布鲁斯不来了  威廉
</br>The Bruce is not coming, William.

01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:35.580
他会来的
</br>He'll come.

01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:39.040
莫尔奈和洛克林都来了
</br>Mornay and Lochlan have come,

01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:42.500
布鲁斯也会的
</br>so will the Bruce.

01:59:45.590 --> 01:59:49.260
好一次聚会
</br>Quite a lovely gathering.

01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:52.180
你觉得呢
</br>Wouldn't you agree?

01:59:55.730 --> 01:59:57.140
弓箭手已做好准备  陛下
</br>The archers are ready, sire.

01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:58.850
先不派弓箭手
</br>Not the archers.

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:00.980
侦察兵告诉我  他们的弓箭手在几英里外呢
</br>My scouts tell me their archers are miles away

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.440
对我们构不成威胁
</br>and no threat to us.

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:06.900
箭很费钱  先打光爱尔兰人  死人不费钱
</br>Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.

02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:10.110
先派步兵和重骑兵
</br>And send in the infantry and cavalry.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.620
步兵
</br>Infantry!

02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:13.370
-步兵  -步兵
</br>- Infantry! - Infantry!

02:00:13.450 --> 02:00:14.660
重骑兵

-重骑兵  -重骑兵

-重骑兵  -重骑兵
</br>- Cavalry! - Cavalry!

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:19.830

-前进  -前进
</br>- Advance! - Advance!

02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:49.550
-今早见到你真高兴  -你好吗
</br>- Good to see you this morning! - Hi. How are you?

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.300
爱尔兰人
</br>Irish.

02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:54.630
你和我们并肩作战真好
</br>Glad to have you with us.

02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.140
看好了
</br>Watch this.

02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.100
莫尔奈  洛克林
</br>Mornay? Lochlan?

02:04:09.190 --> 02:04:11.900
我让莫尔奈在苏格兰的土地翻了一倍
</br>I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland

02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:14.190
还匹配了英格兰的领地给他
</br>with matching estates in England.

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.690
洛克林要的可少得多
</br>Lochlan turned for much less.

02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:19.740
弓箭手
</br>Archers.

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:21.240
您说什么  陛下
</br>I beg pardon, sire.

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.530
这样不会伤到自己人吗
</br>Won't we hit our own troops?

02:04:25.410 --> 02:04:27.040
会
</br>Yes,

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.160
但也会伤到他们
</br>but we'll hit theirs as well.

02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:30.920
我们还有后备军
</br>We have reserves.

02:04:32.250 --> 02:04:33.840
进攻
</br>Attack.

02:04:35.050 --> 02:04:36.210
弓箭手
</br>Archers!

02:04:37.210 --> 02:04:39.220
-弓箭手  -弓箭手
</br>- Archers. - Archers.

02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:45.220
放箭
</br>Loose!

02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:53.610
放箭
</br>Loose!

02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:16.540
派出后续部队
</br>Send in our reinforcements.

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.550
派出剩余军队
</br>Send in the rest!

02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:30.730
给我把华莱士抓来
</br>Bring me Wallace.

02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:32.770
尽可能活捉
</br>Alive, if possible.

02:05:32.850 --> 02:05:35.100
死了也可以
</br>Dead, just as good.

02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:38.400
把胜利的消息传给我们
</br>Send us news of our victory.

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.530
我们可以撤了吧
</br>Shall we retire?

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:06.820
保护国王
</br>Protect the king.

02:09:10.530 --> 02:09:11.820
起来
</br>Get up!

02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:14.160
快起来
</br>Get up!

02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:16.910
起来
</br>Up!

02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:18.330
起来
</br>Get up!

02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:20.710
-把他带走  -天啊
</br>- Get him out of here! - Jesus!

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:27.550
快走
</br>Go!

02:10:27.610 --> 02:10:29.070
我快死了
</br>I'm dying.

02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:34.240
别管我了
</br>Let me be.

02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.240
不行
</br>No.

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:44.580
你会活下来的
</br>You're going to live.

02:10:46.330 --> 02:10:49.380
我已经自由地活了够久了
</br>I've lived long enough to live free.

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.130
看到你变成了这样的人  我很骄傲
</br>Proud to see you become the man you are.

02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:01.760
我是个幸福的人
</br>I'm a happy man.

02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:53.830
我是要入土的人
</br>I'm the one who's rotting,

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.800
但你的脸色比我更死气沉沉
</br>but I think your face looks graver than mine.

02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:03.590
孩子
</br>Son,

02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.270
我们必须和英格兰结盟才能取得这里的胜利
</br>we must have alliance with England to prevail here.

02:13:14.190 --> 02:13:16.190
你做到了
</br>You achieved that.

02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:20.070
你拯救了家族也增加了领地
</br>You saved your family, increased your land.

02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:24.780
总有一天  你会掌握苏格兰的大权
</br>In time, you will have all the power in Scotland.

02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:31.250
领地  封号  人民  权力  我都没有
</br>Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.

02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:34.630
-都没有  -我一无所有
</br>- Nothing? - I have nothing.

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.420
人民为我而战
</br>Men fight for me

02:13:38.050 --> 02:13:40.420
因为如果他们不照做  我就把他们
</br>because if they do not, I throw them off my land

02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:43.720
从我的领地上赶走  让他们的妻儿饿死
</br>and I starve their wives and their children.

02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:48.970
那些在福尔柯克血战的人
</br>Those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk,

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.560
他们为威廉·华莱士而战
</br>they fought for William Wallace,

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:55.440
他为某些我从未有过的东西而奋战
</br>and he fights for something that I've never had.

02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.820
我背叛了他  将那种东西夺走了
</br>And I took it from him when I betrayed him,

02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:04.360
战场上  我从他的脸上看出来了
</br>and l saw it in his face on the battlefield,

02:14:04.450 --> 02:14:06.530
这让我痛彻心扉
</br>and it's tearing me apart!

02:14:07.370 --> 02:14:10.330
是人都会背叛  都会失去本心
</br>All men betray, all lose heart.

02:14:10.410 --> 02:14:13.210
我不想失去本心
</br>I don't want to lose heart!

02:14:17.210 --> 02:14:20.760
我想像他一样坚信
</br>I want to believe, as he does.

02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:30.640
我再也不会做出错误的选择了
</br>I will never be on the wrong side again.

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.320
不要  求求你
</br>No, please!

02:15:48.050 --> 02:15:49.720
他在这儿  快追
</br>There he is! After him!

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:22.250
克雷格大人  莫尔奈的事是真的吗
</br>Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:23.460
是真的
</br>Aye.

02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:27.460
华莱士骑着马进了他的卧室杀了他
</br>Wallace rode into his bedchamber and killed him.

02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:30.510
他现在比以前更碍事了
</br>More a liability now than ever he was.

02:16:30.590 --> 02:16:33.430
谁也不知道下一个会是谁
</br>And there's no telling who'll be next.

02:16:35.470 --> 02:16:37.100
也许是你
</br>Maybe you.

02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:40.810
也许是我
</br>Maybe me.

02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:48.110
无所谓了
</br>It doesn't matter.

02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:52.910
-我是认真的  罗伯特  -我也是
</br>- I'm serious, Robert. - So am I!

02:17:06.130 --> 02:17:08.300
老天啊  操
</br>Christ! Shit!

02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:11.130
给我搜
</br>Search the place!

02:17:13.470 --> 02:17:14.640
洛克林
</br>Lochlan.

02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:24.150
威廉·华莱士杀了五十个人
</br>William Wallace killed 50 men.

02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:26.820
轻而易举
</br>Fifty if it was one.

02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:30.240
他举剑杀了一百人
</br>A hundred men with his own sword.

02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:31.820
一剑劈死就像
</br>Cut through them like...

02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:35.160
就像穿越红海的摩西
</br>Moses through the Red Sea.

02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:11.280
他的传奇故事越传越广  情况会比以往更糟
</br>His legend grows. It will be worse than before.

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.610
他在每个苏格兰城镇召集志愿者
</br>He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town,

02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:17.070
等他召集到足够的人数
</br>and when he replenishes his numbers...

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.790
他们只是绵羊  不堪一击
</br>They're sheep, mere sheep!

02:18:22.290 --> 02:18:25.420
只要打倒领头人他们就溃不成军了
</br>Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:27.330
好了
</br>Very well.

02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:32.720
挑几个你手下最优秀的杀手开个会
</br>Pick a flock of your finest assassins and set a meeting.

02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:36.800
陛下  华莱士以能察觉埋伏而闻名
</br>Milord, Wallace is renowned for his ability to smell an ambush.

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:44.390
如果汉密尔顿大人所言属实
</br>If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct,

02:18:44.730 --> 02:18:48.270
他对我们未来的王后有好感  并信任她
</br>he warmed to our future queen and would trust her.

02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:53.610
我们就派她假意和解
</br>So we'll dispatch her with the notion that she comes in peace.

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:56.530
大人  王妃可能会被绑架
</br>Milord, the princess might be taken hostage

02:18:56.610 --> 02:18:58.660
或命悬一线
</br>or her life be put in jeopardy.

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:02.370
那我儿子会很伤心的
</br>My son would be most distressed by that.

02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:06.540
但要是她被杀死
</br>But in truth, if she were to be killed,

02:19:07.170 --> 02:19:11.920
法国国王就会是我们对抗苏格兰的有力盟友
</br>we would soon find the king of France a useful ally against the Scots.

02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:17.800
你看  作为国王
</br>You see, as king,

02:19:17.890 --> 02:19:21.060
在任何情况下都要找到对自己有利的一面
</br>you must find the good in any situation.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.420
确认是威廉·华莱士
</br>It's William Wallace, sure.

02:19:51.210 --> 02:19:54.050
他扔掉了剑
</br>He's given up his sword.

02:19:54.130 --> 02:19:55.760
做好准备
</br>Be ready.

02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:35.770
夫人
</br>Milady,

02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:36.190
夫人
</br>Milady,

02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:42.150
我收到了你的消息
</br>I received your message.

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:59.130
这是你第二次警告我前方的危险了
</br>This is the second time you have warned me of danger.

02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:02.840
为什么
</br>Why?

02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:06.180
下个月会有一批新的补给运向北方
</br>There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month.

02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:08.260
里面有食物和武器  他们不会
</br>Foods and weapons. They won't...

02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:10.270
别说了
</br>No, stop.

02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:14.390
为什么要帮我
</br>Why do you help me?

02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:22.650
为什么帮我
</br>Why do you help me?

02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:27.120
因为你现在看我的那种眼神
</br>Because of the way you are looking at me now.

02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:22.400
就在我们希望尽失之时
</br>Just when we thought all hope was lost,

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.860
我们的贵族救星来了
</br>our noble saviors have arrived.

02:24:27.570 --> 02:24:30.070
摘掉兜帽
</br>Off with their hoods.

02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:37.000
威廉爵士  我们是来寻求谈判的
</br>Sir William, we've come to seek a meeting.

02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:40.210
有什么可谈的
</br>Well, what's the point?

02:24:40.290 --> 02:24:42.630
你们都宣誓效忠长腿
</br>You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:45.050
对骗子的誓言根本不作数
</br>An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

02:24:45.130 --> 02:24:47.760
我们的人都准备好向你效忠了
</br>Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.

02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:50.300
那就让议会公开宣誓
</br>So let the council swear publicly.

02:24:50.390 --> 02:24:53.760
那做不到  有些人甚至不相信你还活着
</br>We cannot. Some scarcely believe you're alive.

02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:56.890
剩下的人害怕会和莫尔奈一样的下场
</br>Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.

02:24:56.970 --> 02:24:58.680
所以我们邀请你去爱丁堡
</br>So we bid you to Edinburgh.

02:24:58.770 --> 02:24:59.770
两天后与我们会面
</br>Meet us two days from now.

02:24:59.850 --> 02:25:02.440
宽恕我们  我们将团结在你的身后
</br>Pledge us your pardon, and we'll unite behind you.

02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:03.690
苏格兰也会成为一体
</br>Scotland will be one.

02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:07.570
-一体  你说的是我们和你们吧  -不
</br>- One? You mean us and you. - No.

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:11.110
我说的是这个
</br>l mean this.

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.700
这是罗伯特·布鲁斯的信物
</br>It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:27.670
你明知这是个陷阱  跟他说啊
</br>You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:29.680
我觉得如果布鲁斯想杀你
</br>I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you,

02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:31.430
他在福尔柯克就下手了
</br>he'd have done it already at Falkirk.

02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:34.220
-是啊  -我知道  我看见了
</br>- Aye. - I know. I saw.

02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:37.060
不提他  其他人呢
</br>Leaving him aside, what about the others?

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.430
那帮阴险狡诈的混蛋
</br>Nest of scheming bastards!

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:41.480
他们不可能达成一致
</br>They couldn't even agree on the color of shite!

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:42.940
这是个陷阱  你瞎了吗
</br>It's a trap. Are you blind?

02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:44.400
看看我们
</br>Look at us.

02:25:45.900 --> 02:25:49.320
我们得试试  不能孤军奋战
</br>We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:52.740
联合贵族是人民唯一的希望
</br>Joining the nobles is the only hope for our people.

02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:54.280
你知道要是不抓住这机会会怎么样吗
</br>You know what happens if we don't take that chance?

02:25:54.370 --> 02:25:55.490
怎么样
</br>What?

02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.450
什么也不会发生
</br>Nothing.

02:25:59.290 --> 02:26:01.410
我不想当烈士
</br>I don't want to be a martyr.

02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:03.830
我也不想  我想活着
</br>Nor I. I want to live.

02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:07.880
我想有个家  有孩子  平静的生活
</br>I want a home and children and peace.

02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:09.840
-是吗  -是的  我想
</br>- Do you? - Aye, I do.

02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:12.220
我向上帝祈求过
</br>I've asked God for those things.

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:14.680
但没有自由  那些不可能实现
</br>It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:17.680
-那只是个梦  威廉  -梦  那只是
</br>- That's just a dream, William. - A dream? Just a...

02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:23.020
那我们一直都在干什么
</br>Then what have we been doing all this time?

02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:25.100
我们已经活在了梦中
</br>We've lived that dream.

02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:28.860
你梦的不是自由  而是梅伦
</br>Your dream isn't about freedom. It's about Murron.

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:31.860
你当英雄是因为你觉得她在天上看着你
</br>You're doing this to be a hero 'cause you think she sees you.

02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:34.860
我不是觉得她在看着我  她就是在看着我
</br>I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:38.030
你爸爸也在看着你
</br>And your father sees you, too.

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:49.090
上帝啊
</br>Jesus.

02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:53.550
起来  把手给我
</br>Get up. Give us your hand.

02:26:56.890 --> 02:26:58.760
我能和你一起去吗
</br>Shall I come with you?

02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:02.390
不行  我自己去
</br>No. I'll go alone.

02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.190
回头见
</br>I'll see you after.

02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:08.230
好
</br>Right.

02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:15.110
但愿能尽快再见
</br>Sooner rather than later, I hope.

02:27:21.450 --> 02:27:23.750
-他不会来的  -他会来
</br>- He won't come. - He will.

02:27:24.910 --> 02:27:26.500
我知道他会来
</br>I know he will.

02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:42.510
大人  他来了
</br>Milord, he approaches!

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.180
不
</br>No!

02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:34.770
你别插手  罗伯特
</br>Stay out of it, Robert!

02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:38.740
你骗我  你骗我
</br>You lied! You lied!

02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:45.490
不能伤害布鲁斯  我们说好的
</br>Bruce is not to be hurt! That's the arrangement!

02:28:53.290 --> 02:28:54.920
父亲
</br>Father!

02:29:00.930 --> 02:29:03.800
你个腐朽的老东西
</br>You rotting bastard!

02:29:04.350 --> 02:29:06.310
为什么  为什么
</br>Why? Why?

02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:13.810
长腿要抓威廉
</br>Longshanks required Wallace.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:16.020
我们的贵族也是
</br>So did our nobles.

02:29:16.610 --> 02:29:19.650
这就是王冠的代价
</br>That was the price of your crown.

02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:20.860
去死吧
</br>Die!

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.410
你去死吧
</br>I want you to die!

02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:28.870
很快  我就会死而你就会成为国王
</br>Soon enough, I'll be dead and you'll be king.

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:31.290
我不要你的任何东西
</br>I don't want anything from you.

02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:33.460
你根本不是人
</br>You're not a man!

02:29:34.290 --> 02:29:36.380
你不是我父亲
</br>And you're not my father.

02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:45.100
你是我儿子  你一直都知道我的想法
</br>You're my son, and you have always known my mind.

02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:48.470
你蒙骗了我
</br>You deceived me.

02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:51.060
是你任由自己被蒙骗
</br>You let yourself be deceived.

02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:54.690
你心里其实一直都知道这里要发生什么
</br>In your heart, you always knew what had to happen here.

02:29:58.230 --> 02:30:01.860
你终于知道憎恨是什么滋味了
</br>At last, you know what it means to hate.

02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.490
现在你已经准备好成为国王了
</br>Now you're ready to be a king.

02:30:10.410 --> 02:30:14.540
我的憎恨会随你一起死去
</br>My hate will die with you.

02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:21.510
威廉·华莱士
</br>William Wallace,

02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:24.300
你被控犯有严重叛国罪
</br>you stand in taint of high treason.

02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:26.550
背叛了谁
</br>Against whom?

02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:28.350
背叛了你的国王
</br>Against your king.

02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:31.770
你有什么要辩解的吗
</br>Have you anything to say?

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.730
我这辈子
</br>Never in my whole life

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.690
从没宣誓效忠于他
</br>did I swear allegiance to him.

02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:42.820
即便如此  他也是你的国王
</br>It matters not. He is your king.

02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:48.620
认罪  你可以死得痛快一些
</br>Confess, and you may receive a quick death.

02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:52.330
不认罪  你必须在痛苦中净化罪孽
</br>Deny, and you must be purified by pain.

02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:54.000
你认罪吗
</br>Do you confess?

02:30:56.290 --> 02:30:59.380
你认罪吗
</br>Do you confess?

02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:08.800
那么明天便开始你的净化
</br>Then on the morrow, you shall receive your purification.

02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:22.690
-殿下  -我要见囚犯
</br>- Your Highness. - I will see the prisoner.

02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:24.110
国王有令任何人...
</br>We've got orders from the king that nobody...

02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:26.570
国王月内就会驾崩  他的儿子又羸弱不堪
</br>The king will be dead in a month and his son is a weakling.

02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:29.120
你觉得到时候治理国家的会是谁
</br>Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:30.990
立刻开门
</br>Now open this door.

02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:34.250
殿下
</br>Majesty.

02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:42.920
来吧  贱人  站起来
</br>Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

02:31:43.010 --> 02:31:44.420
住手
</br>Stop it!

02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:46.590
出去
</br>Leave me.

02:31:47.470 --> 02:31:49.140
我让你出去
</br>I said leave me!

02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:03.570
夫人
</br>Milady.

02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:09.070
大人  我是来求你
</br>Sir, I come to beg you

02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:13.580
认罪并宣誓效忠国王
</br>to confess all and swear allegiance to the king

02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:15.870
他或许会手下留情
</br>that he might show you mercy.

02:32:16.750 --> 02:32:19.210
他会对我的国家手下留情吗
</br>Will he show mercy to my country?

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.790
手下留情是让你死得痛快一些
</br>Mercy is to die quickly,

02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:24.300
或是囚禁在塔楼
</br>perhaps even live in a tower.

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:26.880
谁知道以后会发生什么
</br>In time, who knows what can happen

02:32:28.510 --> 02:32:30.720
只要你能活着
</br>if you can only live.

02:32:35.180 --> 02:32:37.020
如果我宣誓效忠他
</br>If l swear to him,

02:32:37.810 --> 02:32:40.980
那我已经与死无异了
</br>then all that I am is dead already.

02:32:50.410 --> 02:32:52.990
你会死的  刑罚会很残忍
</br>You will die. It will be awful.

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:55.080
人都会死
</br>Every man dies.

02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:59.870
却不见得都活过
</br>Not every man really lives.

02:33:06.170 --> 02:33:07.710
喝了这个
</br>Drink this.

02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:11.260
这会减轻你的痛苦
</br>It will dull your pain.

02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:15.220
不行  它会麻木我的心智  而我需要它们
</br>No. It will numb my wits, and I must have them all.

02:33:16.470 --> 02:33:18.770
如果我昏过去  或是哀嚎
</br>For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:21.980
那长腿就是打垮了我
</br>then Longshanks will have broken me.

02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:24.940
一想到你会受的折磨我就无法忍受
</br>I can't bear the thought of your torture.

02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:26.770
喝了它吧
</br>Take it.

02:33:31.610 --> 02:33:33.280
好吧
</br>All right.

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:25.170
我来求您饶威廉·华莱士一命
</br>I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:29.920
你还真是喜欢他啊
</br>You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:32.090
我尊敬他
</br>I respect him.

02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:35.550
至少他是个值得尊重的敌人
</br>At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:37.740
请您手下留情  伟大的王
</br>Show mercy, O thou great king,

02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:40.470
赢得人民的尊敬
</br>and win the respect of your own people.

02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:55.030
即使到现在  你也不会宽恕
</br>Even now, you are incapable of mercy.

02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:03.330
而你...
</br>And you...

02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:10.630
对你来说  这个词就和爱一样陌生
</br>To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:13.750
在他还能说话的时候
</br>Before he lost his powers of speech,

02:35:13.750 --> 02:35:15.760
他说他唯一的慰藉就是
</br>he told me his one comfort was

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.930
能活着知道华莱士的死讯
</br>that he would live to know Wallace was dead.

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:38.700
你看
</br>You see,

02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:43.120
我们都会死
</br>death comes to us all.

02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:58.010
在你死前  你记住
</br>But before it comes to you, know this.

02:35:58.090 --> 02:36:00.220
你的血脉也会随你而去
</br>Your blood dies with you.

02:36:02.890 --> 02:36:06.100
我肚子里怀了别人的孩子
</br>A child who is not of your line grows in my belly.

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:13.070
你儿子的王位不会长久  我发誓
</br>Your son will not sit long on the throne, I swear it.

02:36:50.810 --> 02:36:52.810
我很害怕
</br>I'm so afraid.

02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:04.700
请赐我善终的力量
</br>Give me the strength to die well.

02:37:28.930 --> 02:37:30.640
他来了
</br>Here he comes!

02:38:59.650 --> 02:39:02.650
下面就是叛国要付出的惨痛代价
</br>Now behold the awful price of treason!

02:39:09.450 --> 02:39:11.790
你现在要跪下
</br>You will fall to your knees now,

02:39:13.710 --> 02:39:16.620
向国王表明你的忠心
</br>declare yourself the king's loyal subject

02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:19.460
并乞求他的宽恕
</br>and beg his mercy.

02:39:26.470 --> 02:39:28.340
我便会手下留情
</br>And you shall have it.

02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.230
绑住他
</br>Rope!

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:04.710
把他拉上去
</br>Stretch him!

02:40:07.010 --> 02:40:10.180
就这样  拉住
</br>That's it! Stretch him!

02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:27.820
丢人  真丢人
</br>Shame! Shame!

02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:49.840
舒服吗
</br>Pleasant, yes?

02:40:52.890 --> 02:40:54.810
跪起来
</br>Rise to your knees,

02:40:54.890 --> 02:40:57.640
亲吻我斗篷上的皇室纹章
</br>kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

02:40:57.730 --> 02:40:59.890
我便赐你个痛快
</br>and you will feel no more.

02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:42.850
用刑
</br>Rack him!

02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:38.870
受够了吗
</br>Enough?

02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:35.050
这一切都可以立刻结束
</br>It can all end right now.

02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:37.930
平静
</br>Peace.

02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:42.350
说出来就好
</br>Please, just say it.

02:43:43.430 --> 02:43:46.140
喊出  宽恕
</br>Cry out, "Mercy."

02:43:56.820 --> 02:43:58.280
宽恕
</br>Mercy!

02:43:58.370 --> 02:44:00.070
宽恕  宽恕
</br>Mercy! Mercy!

02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.910
宽恕  宽恕
</br>Mercy! Mercy!

02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:07.160
喊吧
</br>Cry out.

02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:10.750
宽恕  宽恕
</br>Mercy! Mercy!

02:44:13.630 --> 02:44:15.210
说吧
</br>Just say it.

02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:18.130
宽恕
</br>Mercy.

02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:21.430
宽恕  宽恕
</br>Mercy! Mercy!

02:44:40.570 --> 02:44:42.700
请求宽恕吧  威廉
</br>Mercy, William.

02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:44.990
-请求宽恕吧  -天啊  快说吧
</br>- Mercy. - Jesus, now say it.

02:44:51.130 --> 02:44:54.590
犯人想说句话
</br>The prisoner wishes to say a word.

02:44:55.010 --> 02:44:57.550
宽恕  宽恕
</br>Mercy! Mercy!

02:44:57.630 --> 02:44:59.630
宽恕
</br>Mercy!

02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:21.410
自由
</br>Freedom!

02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:12.390
被砍头之后
</br>After the beheading,

02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:15.690
威廉·华莱士的身体被五马分尸
</br>William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

02:47:18.610 --> 02:47:21.570
他的头被挂在伦敦桥上
</br>His head was set on London Bridge,

02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:28.700
他的四肢被送往英国的四境
</br>his arms and legs sent to the four corners of Britain

02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.700
作为警告
</br>as a warning.

02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:35.710
但这并没有起到长腿期望的效果
</br>It did not have the effect that Longshanks planned.

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:39.670
而我  罗伯特·布鲁斯
</br>And I, Robert the Bruce,

02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:44.760
亲自前来向英国国王的军队表示效忠
</br>rode out to pay homage to the armies of the English king

02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:48.140
并接受他对我王位的认可
</br>and accept his endorsement of my crown.

02:47:48.930 --> 02:47:51.640
希望你今早洗了屁股
</br>I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:54.180
马上就要有国王亲它了
</br>It's about to be kissed by a king.

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.880
走吧  赶紧完事
</br>Come. Let's get it over with.

02:48:38.350 --> 02:48:39.480
等等
</br>Stop!

02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:59.870
你们曾追随华莱士浴血奋战
</br>You have bled with Wallace!

02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:07.550
现在追随我吧
</br>Now bleed with me.

02:49:48.510 --> 02:49:50.760
华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace!

02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:53.390
华莱士  华莱士  华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

02:49:53.470 --> 02:49:56.010
华莱士  华莱士  华莱士  华莱士
</br>Wallace! Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:17.700
公元1314年
</br>In the year of our Lord, 1314,

02:50:18.910 --> 02:50:22.290
苏格兰的爱国者们在缺衣少粮敌众我寡的情况下
</br>patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered,

02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:26.080
在班诺克本战场上发起进攻
</br>charged the fields of Bannockburn.

02:50:26.170 --> 02:50:29.130
他们像诗中的战士一样战斗
</br>They fought like warrior poets.

02:50:29.210 --> 02:50:31.300
像苏格兰人一样战斗
</br>They fought like Scotsmen,

02:50:32.430 --> 02:50:34.300
赢得了自由
</br>and won their freedom.
